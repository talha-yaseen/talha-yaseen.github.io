</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Wednesday, April 5, 2023 10:24:28 PM
</h4><ul><li>Sam, the inveterate prankster, had a favorite trick, one that amused him well into his eighties. He would tape a thread to a dollar bill and leave it in the middle of the hallway outside his apartment, the other end of the thread extending under his door and resting in his hands. His eye would be fixed to the peephole until someone came upon the bill and stooped to pick it up. Then he would give the thread a swift jerk and snatch the bill away before the passerby could lay a finger on it. He could scarcely control his laughter.
</li><li>To the end, he imagined himself a peasant, unable to swallow his own good fortune.
</li><li>Men of means—financial and social pillars of Canton—were brought low, their possessions sold off one by one, their grand homes vacated, their office suites traded in for a broom, a paint brush, or a snow shovel. One minute they were at the pinnacle of success, the next, holding their hand out to a stranger named “B. Virdot.”
</li><li>He has not lived who gathers gold, Nor has he lived whose life is told In selfish Battles he has won, Or deed of skill he may have done, But he has lived who now and then Has helped along his fellowman.
</li><li>Nothing in my grandfather’s day was as out of fashion as self-pity. Only to later generations, coddled by prosperity, analgesics, and concerns over leisure and longevity, would such flinty self-reliance seem extraordinary or explorations of one’s sorrows become so common as to be featured on daytime TV.
</li><li>In 1900, when much of the Depression-era generation was still young, only one in twenty-five could look forward to reaching sixty-five. One in five newborns died before the age of five and the average life span of a male infant born that year was forty-eight years.
</li><li>“He who gives himself with his alms feeds three, Himself, his hungering Neighbor and Me. (meaning God)”
</li><li>A grandson, Michael, recalled the time when Noble was walking down the street in Coshocton, Ohio, and came across a nun who had a hole in her shoe. Noble insisted she come with him to a shoe store, and there he bought her a new pair.
</li><li>“The Vision of Sir Launfal” by James Russell Lowell. In the poem, a disillusioned knight of King Arthur’s Round Table searches for the Holy Grail but finds only a beggar with whom he shares his food and drink. The beggar, he discovers, is Jesus Christ.
</li><li>Today that nine-year-old daughter, Valerie—the baby in the family—is eighty-five, but she still remembers well what she got that Christmas of 1933: an orange and a little powder-blue change purse adorned with silver metallic beads that opened and closed with a drawstring. The orange was the first fresh fruit to touch her lips in memory. Both likely came from the five dollars Mr. B. Virdot sent her parents that week.
</li><li>She remembers that there were times she could not go to school because she didn’t have shoes.
</li><li>It was a different world, one in which the disgrace came not so much from being poor as from the implicit suggestion that the burdens of others were less onerous than one’s own. To gain another’s pity at the expense of self-respect was a bad bargain. Poverty was viewed not as an individual burden but a societal scourge. In such times, it was often considered self-centered to call attention to one’s own predicament, as if one were oblivious to the circumstances of all those around them.
</li><li>To capitulate to self-pity or public plaints not only exposed weakness in one’s own character but threatened to unravel the composure of others.
</li><li>Several charities that provide relief to Dorohoi report an unemployment rate in excess of 50 percent.
</li><li>His was an ambition fueled less by what he longed to acquire than by what he hoped to shed.
</li><li>But it was also a mitzvah, a Hebrew word meaning “commandment,” but one that has come to mean an act of human kindness—not something to be tainted by money. The truest and highest form of giving is that in which the giver expected and got nothing in return.
</li><li>For men like my grandfather, who took such pride in escaping poverty and in providing for himself and his family, charity represented the final act of capitulation. It was not seen as a stop-gap measure to tide one over, but the repudiation of a lifetime rooted in self-reliance.
</li><li>As an adult he insisted on having a table full of food at every meal and he often would have steak two and even three nights in a row, perhaps to remind himself that he was now a safe distance from the past.
</li><li>“Nothing,” she had written in 1933, “builds morale and inspires self confidence and courage like money in one’s purse.”
</li><li>One afternoon, while his tentmate was cleaning his rifle, he was struck by lightning and was killed instantly. The body was blackened and Sam was close enough to have his own brows singed.
</li><li>Life is mostly froth and bubble, Two things stand like stone, Kindness in another’s trouble, Courage in your own.
</li><li>“My mother named me ‘Bill’ because I arrived on the first of the month,”
</li><li>It must be said that Sam was nearly impossible to work for. My own father worked for him for several years, loved him as a man, but hated him as a boss. He could be mercurial, demanding, and miserly. There is little question that the desperate days of his childhood left a mark on him, as it did on all his siblings. One minute, he could be magnanimous to family and strangers alike, and the next, stingy to the point of cruelty.
</li><li>It is hard to measure the impact of even the smallest unexpected gift on a child who has nothing.
</li><li>In March 2009, the posting of a single janitorial position at a junior high school drew 835 applicants. The one-year contract paid fifteen to sixteen dollars an hour. The Repository hailed the winner as possibly “the luckiest man in Stark County.”

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Friday, April 7, 2023 8:29:56 PM
</h4><ul><li>Real miracles make little noise! Essential events are so simple!
</li><li>So, through us, the universe proved its good will. The condensation of clouds, the solidification of planets, the formation of the first amoeba, the gigantic labour of evolution which led up to man, everything had happily converged, through us, to that quality of delight.
</li><li>Care granted to the sick, welcome offered to the banished, forgiveness itself are worth nothing without a smile enlightening the deed. We communicate in a smile beyond languages, classes, and parties. We are the faithful members of the same church, you with your customs, I with mine.
</li><li>If the traveller, ascending his mountain, in the direction of a star, is completely absorbed by his climbing, he is liable to forget which star is guiding him. If he acts only for the sake of acting, he will get nowhere. The cathedral usher, in thinking too much of hiring his chairs, is likely to forget that he is serving God. Thus if I withdraw myself into a partisan passion, I am liable to forget that a policy has no meaning unless it serves a spiritual truth. We have known, during miraculous hours, a certain quality of human relationship: there is our truth.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Friday, April 7, 2023 11:48:29 PM
</h4><ul><li>It was hard not to compare Mrs Elm to her mother, who treated Nora like a mistake in need of correction.
</li><li>She was so scared of her sudden switch in emotions right then that she kept smiling, as if the smile could keep her in the world she had just been in, the one where Volts was alive and where this man she’d sold guitar songbooks to had rung her doorbell for another reason.
</li><li>‘I don’t think your problem was stage fright. Or wedding fright. I think your problem was life fright.’
</li><li>I had all the chances to make something of my life, and I blew every one of them. Through my own carelessness and misfortune, the world has retreated from me, and so now it makes perfect sense that I should retreat from the world.
</li><li>A person was like a city. You couldn’t let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don’t like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worthwhile.
</li><li>Thomas Hobbes had viewed memory and imagination as pretty much the same thing,
</li><li>‘Well, that you can choose choices but not outcomes. But I stand by what I said. It was a good choice. It just wasn’t a desired outcome.’
</li><li>Fish get depression. They had done tests with zebrafish. They had a fish tank and they drew a horizontal line on the side of it, halfway down, in marker pen. Depressed fish stayed below the line. But give those same fish Prozac and they go above the line, to the top of their tanks, darting about like new. Fish get depressed when they have a lack of stimulation. A lack of everything. When they are just there, floating in a tank that resembles nothing at all.
</li><li>‘If you aim to be something you are not, you will always fail. Aim to be you. Aim to look and act and think like you. Aim to be the truest version of you. Embrace that you-ness. Endorse it. Love it. Work hard at it. And don’t give a second thought when people mock it or ridicule it. Most gossip is envy in disguise.
</li><li>‘If one advances confidently,’ Thoreau had written in Walden, ‘in the direction of his dreams, and endeavours to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.’ He’d also observed that part of this success was the product of being alone. ‘I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude.’
</li><li>Maybe that’s what all lives were, though. Maybe even the most seemingly perfectly intense or worthwhile lives ultimately felt the same. Acres of disappointment and monotony and hurts and rivalries but with flashes of wonder and beauty. Maybe that was the only meaning that mattered. To be the world, witnessing itself. Maybe it wasn’t the lack of achievements that had made her and her brother’s parents unhappy, maybe it was the expectation to achieve in the first place.
</li><li>Every life she had tried so far since entering the library had really been someone else’s dream. The married life in the pub had been Dan’s dream. The trip to Australia had been Izzy’s dream, and her regret about not going had been a guilt for her best friend more than a sorrow for herself. The dream of her becoming a swimming champion belonged to her father. And okay, so it was true that she had been interested in the Arctic and being a glaciologist when she was younger, but that had been steered quite significantly by her chats with Mrs Elm herself, back in the school library. And The Labyrinths, well, that had always been her brother’s dream.
</li><li>‘Dogs can smell when rain is coming, so they often head indoors if they think it’s going to happen. Isn’t that cool? That they can predict the future with their nose?’
</li><li>It was one of life’s rules – Never trust someone who is willingly rude to low-paid service staff
</li><li>Fear was when you wandered into a cellar and worried that the door would close shut. Despair was when the door closed and locked behind you.
</li><li>She realised that you could be as honest as possible in life, but people only see the truth if it is close enough to their reality.
</li><li>‘Life begins,’ Sartre once wrote, ‘on the other side of despair.’
</li><li>We don’t have to do everything in order to be everything, because we are already infinite. While we are alive we always contain a future of multifarious possibility.
</li><li>It is quite a revelation to discover that the place you wanted to escape to is the exact same place you escaped from. That the prison wasn’t the place, but the perspective.

</h4><ul><li>No, Adeline has decided she would rather be a tree, like Estele. If she must grow roots, she would rather be left to flourish wild instead of pruned, would rather stand alone, allowed to grow beneath the open sky. Better that than firewood, cut down just to burn in someone else’s hearth.
</li><li>There is a rhythm to moving through the world alone. You discover what you can and cannot live without, the simple necessities and small joys that define a life. Not food, not shelter, not the basic things a body needs—those are, for her, a luxury—but the things that keep you sane. That bring you joy. That make life bearable.
</li><li>Books, she has found, are a way to live a thousand lives—or to find strength in a very long one.
</li><li>“the great thing about plans is that you can make them for other days, too.”
</li><li>“These days, everyone’s looking down,” muses Sam. “It’s nice to see someone looking up.”
</li><li>Being forgotten, she thinks, is a bit like going mad. You begin to wonder what is real, if you are real. After all, how can a thing be real if it cannot be remembered? It’s like that Zen koan, the one about the tree falling in the woods. If no one heard it, did it happen? If a person cannot leave a mark, do they exist?
</li><li>No way to think in days or weeks when she lives in moments.
</li><li>Henry loves his sister, he does. But Muriel’s always been like strong perfume. Better in small doses. And at a distance.
</li><li>The kind of person who feels like they’re wasting away in a world full of food, because they can’t decide what they want.”
</li><li>The darkness claimed he’d given her freedom, but really, there is no such thing for a woman, not in a world where they are bound up inside their clothes, and sealed inside their homes, a world where only men are given leave to roam.
</li><li>Blink and half your life is gone. I do not want to die as I’ve lived. Born and buried in the same ten-meter plot.

</h4><ul><li>Blink, and you’re twenty-six, and you’re called into the dean’s office because he can tell that your heart’s not in it anymore, and he advises you to find another path, and he assures you that you’ll find your calling, but that’s the whole problem, you’ve never felt called to any one thing. There is no violent push in one direction, but a softer nudge a hundred different ways, and now all of them feel out of reach.
</li><li>Addie frowns. “I guess so,” she says, “but I don’t know; history is something you look back on, not something you really feel at the time. In the moment, you’re just … living. I didn’t want to live forever. I just wanted to live.”
</li><li>And in the photo, we all look so … happy. I remember seeing that picture and realizing that photographs weren’t real. There’s no context, just the illusion that you’re showing a snapshot of a life, but life isn’t snapshots, it’s fluid. So photos are like fictions. I loved that about them. Everyone thinks photography is truth, but it’s just a very convincing lie.”
</li><li>or perhaps it is the liberation that comes with knowing her spectators won’t remember. There is a freedom, after all, in being forgotten.
</li><li>She may not feel the years weakening her bones, her body going brittle with age, but the weariness is a physical thing, like rot, inside her soul. There are days when she mourns the prospect of another year, another decade, another century. There are nights when she cannot sleep, moments when she lies awake and dreams of dying. But then she wakes, and sees the pink and orange dawn against the clouds, or hears the lament of a lone fiddle, the music and the melody, and remembers there is such beauty in the world. And she does not want to miss it—any of it.
</li><li>“But war makes believers out of cynics. Sycophants desperate for salvation, everyone suddenly clinging to their souls, clutching them close like a matron with her finest pearls.”
</li><li>there’s a sleepy ease to all of it, the disorientation of waking after dark added to the effects of so long in the sun. It lends everything a dreamy air, the perfect end to a perfect day.
</li><li>It will be easy to look back and wonder how he could have done it, how he could have given away so much for so little. But in the moment, shoes already skimming night, the simple truth is that he would have sold his soul for less, would have traded an entire life of this for just a day—an hour, a minute, a moment—of peace. Just to numb the pain inside his chest. Just to quiet the storm inside his head.
</li><li>“My uncle had cancer, when I was still in college. It was terminal. The doctors gave him a few months, and he told everyone, and do you know what they did? They couldn’t handle it. They were so caught up in their grief, they mourned him before he was even dead. There’s no way to un-know the fact that someone is dying. It eats away all the normal, and leaves something wrong and rotten in its place. I’m sorry, Addie. I didn’t want you to look at me that way.”
</li><li>That time always ends a second before you’re ready. That life is the minutes you want minus one.
</li><li>“Do you know how you live three hundred years?” she says. And when he asks how, she smiles. “The same way you live one. A second at a time.”
</li><li>Belief is a bit like gravity. Enough people believe a thing, and it becomes as solid and real as the ground beneath your feet. But when you’re the only one holding on to an idea, a memory, a girl, it’s hard to keep it from floating away.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Wednesday, April 12, 2023 12:39:00 AM
</h4><ul><li>Thomas Nagel, similarly, argues that if we consider our lives from the objective, wide perspective, they seem to lack meaning, since any life has only a negligible effect on the universe. If we had not lived, nothing much would have changed for the world at large in the long run.4 Put differently: from the wide perspective, our lives are inconsequential.
</li><li>“Then I said to myself, ‘What befalls the fool will befall me also; why then have I been so very wise?’ And I said to myself that this also is vanity. For of the wise man as of the fool there is no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. How the wise man dies just like the fool!”
</li><li>Thomas Nagel has pointed out that just being greater, without also being of sufficient value, is unhelpful. If “we learned that we were being raised to provide food for other creatures fond of human flesh, who planned to turn us into cutlets before we got too stringy [just as many of us treat chickens today] … that would still not give our lives meaning.”
</li><li>Questions about the meaning of life are questions about what is of sufficient worth in life. A meaningful life is one in which there is a sufficient number of aspects of sufficient value, and a meaningless life is one in which there is not a sufficient number of aspects of sufficient value.
</li><li>those for whom meaninglessness of life is like a buzz, always there in the background, at times softer, at times louder.
</li><li>Our lives are somewhere on the continuum between the poles of absolute meaningfulness and absolute meaninglessness.
</li><li>It is easy, in the crisis, to lose a sense of proportion and context, imagining that in the future things will always continue to be the way that they are during the crisis.
</li><li>It is untrue that if something is meaningful in our life, we would want to devote all our time to it, so that if we do not want to engage with only that particular thing, it cannot be seen as really constituting the meaning of our life.
</li><li>But having no ultimate significance and having no significance at all (“absurd” in Craig’s terms) are very different.
</li><li>The idealization of people, or of humanity at large, can breed hatred of people and of humanity, since implausible expectations are bound to be disappointed, bringing about frustration and anger.
</li><li>When we are cruel to ourselves, we are oftentimes being cruel to a defenseless creature, as most people do not know how to defend themselves from this self-inflicted abuse. We do not hear any complaints, of course, since the objects of this cruelty just continue to bear the thrashing silently, sometimes even believing they deserve to be humiliated and oppressed. But this failure to complain does not make the cruelty legitimate.
</li><li>If I were asked to present the gist of this book in only one sentence, it would be: “Do not be cruel to yourself.”
</li><li>Brooke Alan Trisel presents the analogy of competitive long-distance running.20 If we see life as nothing but participation in that harsh race, where the only thing that matters is to win the gold, silver, or bronze medal, then once others have won those prizes and it is clear that we will not win a medal, there indeed is no longer any point in continuing to run. Some of those interested only in the gold, silver, or bronze medals will go on running because it is not considered polite or good form to stop running; but they will see their running as pointless.
</li><li>Fallibilist theorists of knowledge (a category that includes most contemporary theorists of knowledge) hold that all that we believe to be knowledge might, in principle, be proven false one day. But views that have been sufficiently tested and argued for should be seen as highly corroborated and warranted.
</li><li>As I see it, a person who is decent; who is a good family member, friend, or neighbor; who is curious; and who can enjoy the sight of the trees through the window of the bus on her way to work has already made it. She has a meaningful life. She has passed the threshold. Perhaps Mother Teresa or Bach had even more meaningful lives, but her life is already meaningful. Meaningfulness can be found in growing and enjoying geraniums on the balcony, not only orchids in the conservatory.
</li><li>For example, it will always be true that you had a close, trustful, and blissful moment with a family member; or that you felt some exhilaration in reading a poem or looking at the sea; or that you were a decent person; or that you had a very good year. Even when the moment or year is finished and gone, and no one remembers it (perhaps because, in the distant future, there is no one left to remember it), it will remain forever a fact that at a certain date (even if different calendars are used, or there are no calendars at all and no one to look at them), you or I behaved in fine ways and had fine achievements and experiences. That cannot be changed.
</li><li>Blackburn, for example, writes that if we avoid the perspective that considers the meaning of life in the wider context, the thought of life’s meaninglessness does not arise. Hence, he suggests, we should adopt a narrower perspective that examines life only in the context of the here and now, shunning the point of view of the whole of space and time.
</li><li>Blackburn argues that “when we ask if life has meaning, the first question has to be, to whom? To a witness with the whole of space and time in its view, nothing on a human scale will have meaning (it is hard to imagine how it could be visible at all—there is an awful lot of space and time out there).”
</li><li>Spinoza, an important determinist, suggests that if a stone that has been thrown could think, it too would be convinced that it had freely chosen to be in motion.
</li><li>We feel, to change Voltaire’s dictum, that if there were no ends we would have had to invent them. But once we understand ourselves as inventing ends, there is no point in our doing so.
</li><li>Many of us tend to beautify, sentimentalize, and romanticize the past. We frequently redescribe the suffering we have gone through in a way that helps us to desensitize ourselves to it, while exaggerating to ourselves the pleasures we have had.
</li><li>Many dedicate more thought in one evening to deliberating which restaurant or film they should go to than they do in their entire lifetime to deliberating what would make their lives more meaningful.
</li><li>We should beware of living a life that is only, to use Yeats’s words, “a preparation for something that never happens.”
</li><li>And when we look back at our lives thus far, we should ask ourselves not whether we have lived in the best possible way but whether we have lived in the best possible way given our abilities and limitations, including our fears, inhibitions, and insecurities, our capacity to endure pain, uncertainty, and loneliness, and our gifts or lack thereof.
</li><li>7.Frankl (Man’s Search for Meaning, 130–131) suggests that it is wrong to ask the question “What is the meaning of life?” just as it is wrong to ask what the best move in chess is. Different contexts of the game call for different “best moves,” and it is wrong to consider one of them as the best move in general.
</li><li>Many are like a person who has accounts in several banks. He is now in dire need, but because he has forgotten that he has other bank accounts in which there are plenty of funds, he thinks that he is very poor. Or they are like a person who has fallen into dismal poverty and does not realize that the old, beautiful vase in the attic is actually very valuable.
</li><li>The Practice of the Presence of God, a collection of sayings by Brother Lawrence, a monk in a Carmelite monastery in Paris in the seventeenth century.
</li><li>A corollary is the common-sense principle that, surprisingly, many fail to follow: If it is impossible to achieve something, do not try to achieve it.6 Another corollary is If it is impossible to achieve something, do not blame yourself for not achieving it. And yet another corollary is Do not ignore the good just because not everything is good (or Do not ignore the good just because there is also bad).
</li><li>A fourth important guideline, mentioned in chapter 3, is Do not be cruel to yourself.
</li><li>And a fifth important guideline is Work. Only few people can have a meaningful life without working.

After taking the money they flung the body into the river. Next morning his wife came and, without thinking, betrayed the guest's identity. His mother hanged herself. His sister threw herself into a well.
</li><li>One day, when inspecting my straw mattress, I found a bit of newspaper stuck to its underside. The paper was yellow with age, almost transparent, but I could still make out the letter print. It was the story of a crime. The first part was missing, but I gathered that its scene was some village in Czechoslovakia. One of the villagers had left his home to try his luck abroad. After twenty-five years, having made a fortune, he returned to his country with his wife and child. Meanwhile his mother and sister had been running a small hotel in the village where he was born. He decided to give them a surprise and, leaving his wife and child in another inn, he went to stay at his mother's place, booking a room under an assumed name. His mother and sister completely failed to recognize him. At dinner that evening he showed them a large sum of money he had on him, and in the course of the night they slaughtered him with a hammer. After taking the money they flung the body into the river. Next morning his wife came and, without thinking, betrayed the guest's identity. His mother hanged herself. His sister threw herself into a well.
</li><li>Still, to my mind he overdid it, and I'd have liked to have a chance of explaining to him, in a quite friendly, almost affectionate way, that I have never been able really to regret anything in all my life. I've always been far too much absorbed in the present moment, or the immediate future, to think back.
</li><li>We cannot blame a man for lacking what it was never in his power to acquire.
</li><li>And then a rush of memories went through my mind—memories of a life which was mine no longer and had once provided me with the surest, humblest pleasures: warm smells of summer, my favorite streets, the sky at evening, Marie's dresses and her laugh.
</li><li>For after taking much thought, calmly, I came to the conclusion that what was wrong about the guillotine was that the condemned man had no chance at all, absolutely none. In fact, the patient's death had been ordained irrevocably. It was a foregone conclusion. If by some fluke the knife didn't do its job, they started again. So it came to this, that—against the grain, no doubt—the condemned man had to hope the apparatus was in good working order!
</li><li>And, on a wide view, I could see that it makes little difference whether one dies at the age of thirty or threescore and ten—since, in either case, other men and women will continue living, the world will go on as before. Also, whether I died now or forty years hence, this business of dying had to be got through, inevitably.
</li><li>Supposing she were dead, her memory would mean nothing; I couldn't feel an interest in a dead girl. This seemed to me quite normal; just as I realized people would soon forget me once I was dead.
</li><li>I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe.

</li><li>Further, James says, attention and belief are the same thing. What you give your attention to is the key to what you believe. Whoever or whatever commands your attention also controls what you believe.
</li><li>Know then that the world exists for you. For you is the phenomenon perfect. What we are, that only can we see. All that Adam had, all that Caesar could, you have and can do. Adam called his house Heaven and earth; Caesar called his house Rome; you perhaps call yours a cobbler’s trade; a hundred acres of ploughed land; or a scholar’s garret. Yet line for line and point for point your dominion is as great as theirs, though without the fine names. Build therefore your own world.
</li><li>“The greatest impression of character is made by that person who consents to have no character. He who sympathizes with and runs through the whole circle of attributes can not afford to be an individual.”
</li><li>I perceive that we partially die ourselves through sympathy at the death of each of our friends or near relatives. Each such experience is an assault on our vital force. It becomes a source of wonder that they who have lost many friends still live. After long watching around the sickbed of a friend, we, too, partially give up the ghost with him, and are the less to be identified with this state of things.
</li><li>If we wish to conquer undesirable emotional tendencies in ourselves, we must assiduously, and in the first instance cold-bloodedly, go through the outward movements of those contrary dispositions which we prefer to cultivate. The reward of persistency will infallibly come, in the fading out of the sullenness or depression and the advent of real cheerfulness and kindliness in their stead. Smooth the brow, brighten the eye, contract the dorsal rather than the ventral aspect of the frame, and speak in a major key, pass the genial compliment, and your heart must be frigid indeed if it do not gradually thaw!

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Monday, April 17, 2023 3:20:09 PM
</h4><ul><li>The socially unacceptable habit of thinking led him directly to realize that his entire life so far had been a time-wasting delusion.
</li><li>My parents were Christian, but belonging to a Christian family does not make you a Christian any more than having a baker for a father makes you a loaf of bread. Each person has to make his or her own decision.
</li><li>Besides, Jesus was coming soon! I didn’t think the world would last long enough for me to go to college or get married or raise a family.
</li><li>The bible teaches: “Take no thought for tomorrow. Tomorrow will take thought of the things of itself.”
</li><li>I recall only two or three times during all those years when someone on the street would reject what I was saying, and it was a huge surprise to me when they simply walked away.
</li><li>I now know it was negligent, as a parent of young children, to sell myself so cheaply, allowing the clients to reap the profits while my family very often struggled to eat.
</li><li>I finally realized that faith is a cop-out, a defeat—an admission that the truths of religion are unknowable through evidence and reason. It is only indemonstrable assertions that require the suspension of reason, and weak ideas that require faith.
</li><li>You can’t believe if you don’t have the freedom not to believe.
</li><li>No one can tell you what to think. Not your teachers. Not your parents. Not your minister, priest, or rabbi. Not your friends or relatives. Not this book. You are the boss of your own mind. If you have used your own mind to find out what is true, then you should be proud! Your thoughts are free.
</li><li>“Since you obviously imagine that the Second Law, which is derived from within the universe, applies to the universe as a whole, does the First Law also apply? Since the First Law states that energy/matter cannot be created, doesn’t that rule out the creation of the universe?”
</li><li>Mark Twain said the same thing better: “Heaven for climate; hell for society.”
</li><li>Justice means that punishment is administered with the exact amount of severity that is deserved for the crime that is committed. We don’t put children in prison for stealing cookies, and we don’t merely fine a murderer $50. Mercy, on the other hand, means that punishment is administered with less severity than deserved. When the police officer lets you off with a warning instead of a ticket for breaking the speed limit, that is mercy. If God is infinitely merciful, he can never be just. If God is ever just (not to mention infinitely just), then he cannot be infinitely merciful. A God who is both infinitely merciful and just not only does not exist, he cannot exist.
</li><li>But I wonder if he thought about the fact that the qibla (a directional prayer wall) is a flat-earth concept. And why does it matter which direction you pray? If God is everywhere, how can you turn and face him?
</li><li>“You people are so nice,” I told him. “Well, Dan,” he replied, “Allah commands me to be nice to you.” I was stunned. Allah commands me to be nice to you. I didn’t say a word, but I was thinking, “So—you don’t really want to be nice to me on your own? You actually want to be cruel, but you are restraining yourself? You don’t find in me any qualities that merit your admiration? You are forcing yourself to pretend to be my friend in order to please your God? I’m supposed to be impressed with that?”
</li><li>John Allen Paulos, in his book Irreligion,
</li><li>Many claim that their behavior is improved by their belief in God, but so is the behavior of millions of children during the middle weeks of December.
</li><li>There is a difference between not believing there is a god and believing there is no god—one is the absence of belief and the other is the presence of belief.
</li><li>Faith is intellectual bankruptcy. With faith, you don’t have to put any work into proving your case or overcoming objections. You can “just believe.”
</li><li>Using probability after the fact is like a lottery winner saying, “It was highly unlikely that out of the millions of entrants I could have picked the right ticket, therefore someone must have caused me to win.”
</li><li>How could he have created an angel named Lucifer who possessed some quirk in his character that would cause him to go wrong? If this were deliberate, then God is an accessory to evil. If it were accidental, then God is not omnipotent.
</li><li>Time is a dimension of space-time. Things that exist can be measured along that dimension. We can meaningfully talk about “the beginning of the Civil War,” but we cannot make any sense of the phrase “beginning of time” as if it were just a very long ruler. That would be like measuring the very concept of measuring, which is jumping up one logical sphere.
</li><li>To ask seriously if God or the bible is moral (with a possible negative answer) is to assume that “moral” means something apart from God, and that we already know what it means independently of the bible.
</li><li>“And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks upon the Sabbath day. And they that found him brought him unto Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation. And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him. And the Lord said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp. And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the Lord commanded Moses.”
</li><li>Bertrand Russell said, “Men tend to have the beliefs that suit their passions. Cruel men believe in a cruel God and use their belief to excuse their cruelty. Only kindly men believe in a kindly God, and they would be kindly in any case.”
</li><li>In the Old Testament, hell is just death or the grave. With Jesus, hell became a place of everlasting torment.
</li><li>I personally think that the negative version is more useful. The problem with “Do unto others” is, what if you have bad taste? What if you are a masochist? Should you “do unto others” what you would like to have done unto yourself? What if you enjoy being preached at? Should you pester those who might not enjoy it? Should you prepare meals or buy gifts for others based on what you like? What if you are an ascetic? Would you withhold a comfortable life from others? What if you have bizarre sexual preferences? Should you do unto others as you would have them do unto you?
</li><li>“Value” is a concept of relative worth. And since concepts, as far as we know, exist only in brains, which are material things, it is meaningless, even dangerous, to talk of cosmic moral absolutes. The assessment of value requires the use of reason. In other words, morality comes from within humanity. If intelligent life had not appeared on this planet, morality would not exist.
</li><li>“I am convinced that I am acting as the agent of our Creator. By fighting off the Jews, I am doing the Lord’s work.” (Mein Kampf) Hitler credited Jesus as his inspiration. In a 1926 Nazi Christmas celebration, he boasted, “Christ was the greatest early fighter in the battle against the world enemy, the Jews… The work that Christ started but could not finish, I—Adolf Hitler—will conclude.”
</li><li>Evolution shows how complexity arises from simplicity. Creationism can’t do that. Creationism tries to explain complexity with more complexity, which only replaces one mystery with another mystery.
</li><li>“Is it more probable that nature should go out of her course, or that a man should tell a lie? We have never seen, in our time, nature go out of her course; but we have good reason to believe that millions of lies have been told in the same time; it is, therefore, at least millions to one, that the reporter of a miracle tells a lie.”
</li><li>Robert Price elaborates: “When a group has staked everything on a religious belief, and ‘burned their bridges behind them,’ only to find this belief disconfirmed by events, they may find disillusionment too painful to endure. They soon come up with some explanatory rationalization, the plausibility of which will be reinforced by the mutual encouragement of fellow believers in the group. In order to increase further the plausibility of their threatened belief, they may engage in a massive new effort at proselytizing. The more people who can be convinced, the truer it will seem. In the final analysis, then, a radical disconfirmation of belief may be just what a religious movement needs to get off the ground.”
</li><li>(I told them I think the only difference between Africa and the United States is that we Americans know how to hide our corruption better.)
</li><li>If we waste any moment of our precious lives on the hope of an afterlife, we rob ourselves of real joy and value in the here and now. Our lives are all we have, and we should enjoy them to the fullest, minute by fragile minute. Bertrand Russell wrote: “I believe that when I die I shall rot, and nothing of my ego will survive. I am not young and I love life. But I should scorn to shiver with terror at the thought of annihilation. Happiness is nonetheless true happiness because it must come to an end, nor do thought and love lose their value because they are not everlasting.”
</li><li>My response is that there is indeed no purpose of life. There is purpose in life. If there were a purpose of life, then that would cheapen life. It would make us tools or slaves of someone else’s purpose. Like a hammer that hangs on the garage wall waiting for someone to build something, if we humans were designed for a purpose then we would be subservient in the universe. Our value would not be in ourselves. It would exist in our submission to the will of the toolmaker. That is slavery to a master, or infant dependency on a father figure. Besides, if there is a god, what is the purpose of his life? If he doesn’t need a purpose, why do we?
</li><li>Dawkins suggests that dependency on a father figure during childhood may be hard-wired into our genes, a necessary survival tactic of a premature primate.
</li><li>The Big Bang is not an “event.” An event takes place in time and space: it needs a context. Since time and space are a part of the universe itself, calling the Big Bang an “event” would place it in a context beyond itself, which amounts to a presumption of transcendence.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Wednesday, April 19, 2023 10:35:28 AM
</h4><ul><li>Our demons do not haunt us at nighttime. They strike in the morning. We are at our most vulnerable when we wake, for that is when the memory of who we are, and how we got here, returns.
</li><li>Marcus controlled an empire that covered an area equal to roughly half the continental United States.
</li><li>Should I get out of bed? This question, I believe, is the one truly serious philosophical problem. If a philosophy can’t extract us from under the covers, what good is it?
</li><li>What Marcus Aurelius fears most is not death but forgetting. He constantly reminds himself to live fully.
</li><li>“Enough of this wretched whining, monkey life.… You could be good today. But instead you chose tomorrow.”
</li><li>Duty comes from inside, obligation from outside. When we act out of a sense of duty, we do so voluntarily to lift ourselves, and others, higher. When we act out of obligation, we do so to shield ourselves, and only ourselves, from repercussions.
</li><li>“Our culture has generally tended to solve its problems without experiencing its questions.”
</li><li>As much as he loved conversation, Socrates, I think, saw it as simply another tool in his kit. All this enlightened kibitzing had a goal: to know himself. By talking to others he learned how to converse with himself.
</li><li>As Voltaire said, the best judge of a person is not the answers they give but the questions they ask.
</li><li>The more obvious something seems, the more urgent the need to question it.
</li><li>From ancient times, long before Socrates, Indian sages have practiced brahmodya, a competition where contestants aim to articulate absolute truth. The contest always ends in silence. As author Karen Armstrong explains, “The moment of insight came when they realized the inadequacy of their words, and thus intuited the ineffable.”
</li><li>“Ask yourself if you are happy and you cease to be so,” said the British philosopher John Stuart Mill, articulating the Pleasure Paradox (also known as Paradox of Hedonism).
</li><li>“All traveling becomes dull in exact proportion to its rapidity.”
</li><li>“I have never thought so much, existed so much, lived so much, been so much myself… as in the journeys which I have made alone and on foot,” he said. Walking saved Rousseau’s life. It also killed him.
</li><li>Rousseau was what today we’d call high maintenance. “A difficult friend, a disappointing lover, and an impossible employee,” says author Leo Damrosch in his excellent biography of Rousseau.
</li><li>Rousseau’s philosophy can be summed up in four words: nature good, society bad. He believed in the “natural goodness of man.” In his Discourse on Inequality, he paints a picture of man in his natural state, “wandering in the forests, without industry, without speech, without domicile, without want and without liaisons, with no need of his fellow-men, likewise with no desire to harm them.” Nobody is born mean-spirited, petty, vindictive, paranoid. Society makes them that way. Rousseau’s “savage man” lives in each moment with no regrets about the past or worries about the future.
</li><li>For most of European history, people considered mountains barbaric; no sane person would voluntarily travel to one. Only in the eighteenth century did they become objects of admiration.
</li><li>Nietzsche regularly embarked on spirited two-hour jaunts in the Swiss Alps, convinced “all truly great thoughts are conceived by walking.”
</li><li>About six million years ago, early hominids got off their knuckles, stood up straight, and walked on two feet. This new, erect posture had many unexpected benefits. It freed up hands for toolmaking, as well as pointing, caressing, gesturing, hand-holding, bird-flipping, nose-picking, and nail-biting.
</li><li>To my surprise, it is the philosopher-emperor Marcus who answers. Respond to adversity, real or imagined, not with self-pity or hand-wringing, but simply by starting over. Viewed this way, life no longer feels like a narrative gone awry, or a botched ending. None of that is real. There are no endings. Only an infinite chain of beginnings.
</li><li>Reveries is my favorite of Rousseau’s writings.
</li><li>Good philosophy, like a good lightbulb, brightens the room. Where the bulb was manufactured, how much it cost, its wattage, its age, the science behind it—none of this matters as long as it illuminates the room.
</li><li>“Thoreau was literally the most childlike, unconscious and unblushing egotist it has ever been my fortune to encounter in the ranks of manhood,” said Henry James Sr., father of Henry James the novelist and William James the philosopher.
</li><li>Seeing is less like photography and more like language. We don’t see the world so much as converse with it. What is that? Looks like a coffee mug, you say? Let me check my database and get back to you. Yep, it’s a mug. We don’t see the mug in front of us. We tell ourselves it is there. The coffee mug sends electromagnetic waves, nothing more, to our eye and brain. From that raw data, we create information, then meaning—in this case, that the object in front of us is called a “coffee mug.”
</li><li>Art, says Schopenhauer, “takes away the mist.” The illusion of individuality dissolves and “thus we are no longer able to separate the perceiver from the perception, but the two have become one, since the entire consciousness is filled and occupied by a single image of perception.”
</li><li>William Styron, in his memoir on depression, Darkness Visible,
</li><li>For Schopenhauer, noise was more than an annoyance. It was a barometer of character. One’s tolerance for noise, he believed, is inversely proportional to his intelligence. “Therefore, when I hear dogs barking unchecked for hours in the courtyard of a house, I know what to think of the inhabitants.”
</li><li>Political bonds, Epicurus thought, reduced your self-sufficiency, and amounted to outsourcing your happiness. His motto was Lathe Biosas. “Live in obscurity.”
</li><li>“Let nothing be done in your life, which will cause you fear if it becomes known to your neighbor,” said Epicurus.
</li><li>Rob’s attitude is pure Epicurus. If goodness comes your way, enjoy it. Don’t seek it. Good things come to those who don’t expect good things to come to them. Rob doesn’t expend energy hunting for these baubles. They simply happen at him. When they do, he is grateful.
</li><li>“Yes. I would say good enough is good enough. It leaves you time for the more important parts of life. Besides, nothing is enough for the man to whom enough is too little,” says Tom, channeling Epicurus.
</li><li>Impatience is a greediness for the future. Patience is a generous attitude toward time.
</li><li>People immersed in flow are not self-absorbed, for there is no self to be absorbed. No musician, only music. No dancer, only dancing. Here is how an avid sailor describes being in flow. “One forgets oneself, one forgets everything, seeing only the play of the boat with the sea, the play of the sea around the boat, leaving aside everything not essential to that game.” You don’t need to sail the Atlantic or climb Everest to experience flow. You just need to pay attention.
</li><li>It doesn’t take much, says Weil. A simple five-word question can soften a heart, and change a life: “What are you going through?” These words are so powerful, says Weil, because they recognize the sufferer, “not only as a unit in a collection, or a specimen from the social category labeled ‘unfortunate,’ but as a man, exactly like us, who was one day stamped with a special mark by affliction.”
</li><li>I prefer Iris Murdoch’s term: “unselfing.” The British novelist and philosopher describes one such moment of unselfing. She was looking out her window, feeling anxious and resentful due to a perceived slight earlier in the day, when she spotted a hovering kestrel. “In a moment everything is altered,” she says. “The brooding self with its hurt vanity has disappeared. There is nothing now but kestrel. And when I return to thinking of the other matter it seems less important.”
</li><li>My problem, says Weil, is that I have yoked action to results. Life doesn’t work that way, nor does attention. An attentive life is a risky one. Results are not guaranteed. We don’t know where our attention will lead, if anywhere. Pure attention, the kind Weil advocated, is untainted by external motives such as impressing your friends or advancing your career. The person who applies his full attention to something—anything—makes progress “even if his effort produces no visible fruit,” says Weil.
</li><li>Simone Weil’s words. “We do not obtain the most precious gifts by going in search of them but by waiting for them.”
</li><li>I rationalized if Kailash, an orphan, didn’t work for me, he’d work for someone else, and who knows how that person would treat him? Washing my hands of Kailash seemed like a cop-out.
</li><li>As Lord Krishna, an incarnation of God, tells Arjuna: “You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction.”
</li><li>No man, said Gandhi, “takes another down a pit without descending into it himself.”
</li><li>Any victory earned through violent means is illusory; it only postpones the arrival of the next bloody chapter.
</li><li>In 1939 and 1940, Gandhi wrote a series of letters to Hitler, urging him to take the path of peace. Shortly afterward, in what is surely one of history’s most wrongheaded statements, Gandhi said: “I do not believe Herr Hitler to be as bad as he is portrayed.”
</li><li>Mark Juergensmeyer, author of Gandhi’s Way: A Handbook of Conflict Resolution.
</li><li>At his death, Gandhi’s worldly possessions consisted of a pair of spectacles, a wooden bowl (for taking his meals), his pocket watch, and, from a Japanese friend, three tiny porcelain monkeys, signifying “see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.”
</li><li>“The Great Asymmetry,” the late Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould called this phenomenon. “Every spectacular incident of evil will be balanced by 10,000 acts of kindness,” he said.
</li><li>Kindness honored is kindness multiplied. Kindness is contagious. Witnessing acts of moral beauty triggers a flood of physical and emotional responses. Observing acts of kindness encourages us to act more kindly ourselves, a phenomenon confirmed in several recent studies.
</li><li>She is engaging in zuihitsu, or “following the brush.” It’s a Japanese literary technique that is not a technique, which strikes me as the perfect way to write a book that is not a book. A writer practicing zuihitsu isn’t afraid to follow a hunch, scratch an intellectual itch, then circle back, or not. The writer doesn’t impose structure but, rather, allows one to emerge.
</li><li>Delight, unlike pleasure, contains an element of surprise, an unexpected frisson. And delight, unlike pleasure, leaves no bitter aftertaste. You never saw the delight coming so you don’t miss it when it’s gone.
</li><li>In Japan beauty was—and to an extent still is—considered a moral virtue. A morally upstanding person is an aesthetically attuned one. Beauty is an essential ingredient not only for the good life but the good person, too. Making the world a bit more beautiful is a generous, selfless act.
</li><li>Hermann Hesse said: “The man who for the first time picks a small flower so that he can have it near him while he works has taken a step toward joy in life.”
</li><li>Groundhog Day is my favorite movie. By a mile. I must have watched it dozens of times.
</li><li>“How can anyone become a thinker if he does not spend at least a third of the day without passions, people and books?”
</li><li>Once, while visiting the composer Richard Wagner, Nietzsche left a bag at a railway station. Inside were a precious volume of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s essays and an autographed copy of Wagner’s Ring des Nibelungen operas.
</li><li>The spirit of every good philosopher, Nietzsche said, is that of a dancer. Not necessarily a good dancer. “Better to dance ponderously than to walk lamely,” he said, and did. He couldn’t muster even a few decent steps on the dance floor. So be it. The good philosopher, like the good dancer, is willing to make a fool of himself.
</li><li>It is an “as if” approach. View the world as if another level of reality, the noumenon, lies beneath the surface. Live your life as if it repeats endlessly.
</li><li>“That’s fucking crazy. It will never work, but go ahead and try.”
</li><li>Too often we confuse what is ours and what is not. There’s no need for this confusion, say the Stoics. It’s simple. Nothing is ours, not even our bodies. We always rent, never own. This is liberating. If there is nothing to lose there is nothing to fear losing.
</li><li>She feared old age even more than death. Death is “absolute nothingness” and therefore oddly comforting, she reasoned. But old age? Old age is “life’s parody.”
</li><li>Old age does not produce new personality traits so much as it amplifies existing ones. As we age, we become more intensely ourselves. Usually, not in a good way. The fiscally cautious young man grows into a miserly old grouch. The admirably determined young woman grows into an infuriatingly stubborn old lady.
</li><li>Beauvoir said, “My life would be a beautiful story come true, a story I would make up as I went along.” This is existentialism. There is no script to follow, no stage directions. We are author, director, and actor of our own life story.
</li><li>A lot of us sleepwalk through life like this. We confuse our social roles with our essence. We get “taken hold of by others,” says Sartre, and see ourselves only as they do. We forfeit our freedom, and lack authenticity
</li><li>Montaigne, an experimenter like Gandhi, believed in trying anything once. “We must push against a door to know it is closed to us,” he said.
</li><li>Simone de Beauvoir plays with that question in her novel All Men Are Mortal. The protagonist is an Italian nobleman named Raymond Fosca. He is immortal, thanks to a potion he drank back in the fourteenth century. At first he considers immortality an incredible blessing, and strives to put it to good use. He wants to improve the lives of his people. Yet he comes to view his immortality as a curse. Everyone he loves dies. He is bored. (Even his dreams are boring.) He lacks generosity since, as an immortal, he has nothing to sacrifice. His life lacks urgency, and vitality. We may fear death, but the alternative, immortality, is far worse.
</li><li>Montaigne’s philosophy boils down to this: Trust yourself. Trust your experiences. Trust your doubts, too. Let them guide you through life, and to the threshold of death. Cultivate the capacity to be surprised, by others and by yourself. Tickle yourself. Remain open to the possibility of possibility. And, for God’s sake, says Montaigne, joining hands with his compatriot Simone Weil, pay attention.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Thursday, April 20, 2023 6:00:23 PM
</h4><ul><li>There would end any talk about boa constrictors, or ancient forests, or the stars. I would lower myself to their level and prattle about bridges, and golf, politics, and neckties. Oh how it pleased the grown-ups to have met such a logical man.
</li><li>I have given you these details about the asteroid, because of the grown-ups – they seem to love numbers. When they hear that you have made a new friend, they ask the most unimportant questions. They never say, ‘What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?’ Instead, they ask: ‘How old is he? How many brothers has he? What is his weight? Does his father make much money?’ From these numbers alone they think they have learned everything about him. For instance, if you were to say to the grown-ups: ‘I saw a beautiful brick house with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,’ they would be confused. But if you say, ‘I saw a house worth a million dollars,’ they would remark, ‘What a pretty house!’
</li><li>It has been six years since my friend departed, along with his sheep. I must try to describe him here, to make sure that I don’t ever forget him. To forget a friend is terrible. Not everyone has had a friend.
</li><li>‘I know of a planet where there’s a red-faced man. He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked upon a star. He has never loved anyone. He has done nothing else but sums. And he repeats to himself daily, just like you: “I am busy with something important!” And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man, he is a balloon!’
</li><li>‘Then you must judge yourself,’ said the king. ‘It is the hardest thing to do. It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. But if you succeed, then you are indeed a wise man.’
</li><li>‘Where are the people?’ the little prince said, picking up the conversation again. ‘It is a bit lonely in the desert.’ ‘It is also lonely among men,’ the snake said.
</li><li>‘Rituals make one day different from the other days, or one hour from the other. My hunters have a ritual. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is the perfect day for me! I can take a walk right up to the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at any odd time, every day would be the same, and I would never get a day off.’
</li><li>‘Goodbye,’ said the fox. ‘Here is my secret, it’s a simple secret: it is only through your heart that you can see clearly. The eyes do not see that which is most important.’
</li><li>And that was the truth. I have always loved the desert. You may sit down on a sand dune but you will see or hear nothing. Yet, there is something that glows in the silence.
</li><li>‘When you look at the starry sky, and as I will live on one of those stars, and I’ll be laughing on one of those stars, it will seem to you that all the stars are laughing. You will have stars that can laugh!’

</h4><ul><li>Adam Smith described him as “approaching as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man, as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit.”
</li><li>And as reasoning is not the source, whence either disputant derives his tenets; it is in vain to expect, that any logic, which speaks not to the affections, will ever engage him to embrace sounder principles.
</li><li>His family was comfortable enough to employ servants, as was usual for the middle classes of the time, but it was not rich.
</li><li>In later life Hume would often talk of his love of solitude and his dislike for large gatherings, preferring “the company of a few select companions, with whom I can, calmly and peaceably, enjoy the feast of reason, and try the justness of every reflection, whether gay or serious, that may occur to me.”
</li><li>Trainspotting, Irvine Walsh’s novel about drug addicts in the late 1980s,
</li><li>In his Treatise, he argued that virtues had to be either useful or agreeable, and that wasn’t true of “celibacy, fasting, penance, mortification, self-denial, humility, silence, solitude, and the whole train of monkish virtues.” These “serve to no manner of purpose; neither advance a man’s fortune in the world, nor render him a more valuable member of society; neither qualify him for the entertainment of company, not encrease his power of self-enjoyment.”
</li><li>Hume had fallen into a deep depression, what he called the “disease of the learned.” The cure was to study less intensively, to exercise daily, and to make time for relaxation and social intercourse.
</li><li>For Hume, the Stoics ask us to go too much against the grain of human nature. “Philosophers have endeavoured to render happiness entirely independent of every thing external,” he complained. “That degree of perfection is impossible to be attained.”
</li><li>“I am apt to suspect the negroes to be naturally inferior to the whites. There scarcely ever was a civilized nation of that complexion, nor even any individual eminent either in action or speculation.”
</li><li>The lesson is clear: never slavishly follow even the greatest minds, for they too have prejudices, weaknesses, and blind spots.
</li><li>The most troubling lesson of the Third Reich is that it was supported largely by ordinary people who would have led blameless lives had they not by chance lived through particular toxic times.
</li><li>Hence he wrote that “I resolved to make a very rigid Frugality supply my Deficiency of Fortune, to maintain unimpaired my Independency, and to regard every object as contemptible, except the Improvement of my Talents in Literature.”
</li><li>Hume didn’t value great luxury or excess but was delighted to have the kind of “modest fortune” that enabled him to pursue his work freely.
</li><li>Malebranche is best known for his theory of “occasionalism,” which says that objects have no causal powers, and that it is God who makes all effects follow from their usual causes.
</li><li>As he wrote in an essay, “When men act in a faction, they are apt, without shame or remorse, to neglect all the ties of honour and morality, in order to serve their party.”
</li><li>A skeptical, open mind has nothing to fear and much to gain from seeking the company and opinions of those it seriously disagrees with.
</li><li>Since the evidence that a miracle has actually occurred will always be weaker than the evidence that it has not, there can never be any grounds for believing that a miracle has actually taken place.
</li><li>The wise, warns Hume, give little credence to any report that suits the reporter, “whether it magnifies his country, his family, or himself, or in any other way strikes in with his natural inclinations and propensities. But what greater temptation than to appear a missionary, a prophet, an ambassador from heaven?”
</li><li>Miracles are always invoked as evidence in support of a particular religion. But all religions claim miracles. Further, they are all in disagreement with each other, and none is believed by a majority of humankind. Therefore everyone who testifies for the truth of their own religion’s miracles is offering evidence against the miracles of others. So “all the prodigies of different religions are to be regarded as contrary facts, and the evidences of these prodigies, whether weak or strong, as opposite to each other.”
</li><li>Do not waste time thinking about what may or may not happen in a possible world when you have no reason to believe it happens in the actual world.
</li><li>Hume believed that habit was the key to virtuous behavior: practice doing the right thing in every situation, trivial or important, and you will build the kind of character that tends to act well in all situations.
</li><li>If we were to sum up the purpose of the Treatise in one sentence, it would be to end the hope of establishing anything about the real world that is certain and beyond doubt, and to reconcile philosophy to a more modest task of reaching only tentative conclusions that are grounded in experience.
</li><li>Hume, however, argues that we have never seen any such thing. We have never observed cause and effect in action. All we have observed is one event following another. We can never see the “necessary connection” between the two that we call causation.
</li><li>Hume never seriously doubts that cause and effect are real. All he doubts is our ability to ground this belief in reason or observation.
</li><li>We have only a fragile grip on reality, one we cling to by custom, habit, and instinct.
</li><li>You cannot judge a good argument by an absolute standard. The best argument is simply the one that has no better rival.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Friday, April 21, 2023 2:06:03 PM
</h4><ul><li>Most people who begin to suffer from the illness are laid low in the morning, with such malefic effect that they are unable to get out of bed. They feel better only as the day wears on. But my situation was just the reverse. While I was able to rise and function almost normally during the earlier part of the day, I began to sense the onset of the symptoms at midafternoon or a little later—gloom crowding in on me, a sense of dread and alienation and, above all, stifling anxiety.
</li><li>William James, who battled depression for many years, gave up the search for an adequate portrayal, implying its near-impossibility when he wrote in The Varieties of Religious Experience: “It is a positive and active anguish, a sort of psychical neuralgia wholly unknown to normal
</li><li>The cosmic loneliness of Meursault, the hero of that novel, so haunted me that when I set out to write The Confessions of Nat Turner I was impelled to use Camus’s device of having the story flow from the point of view of a narrator isolated in his jail cell during the hours before his execution. For me there was a spiritual connection between Meursault’s frigid solitude and the plight of Nat Turner—his rebel predecessor in history by a hundred years—likewise condemned and abandoned by man and God.
</li><li>Camus, Romain told me, occasionally hinted at his own deep despondency and had spoken of suicide. Sometimes he spoke in jest, but the jest had the quality of sour wine, upsetting Romain.
</li><li>Romain Gary—twice winner of the Prix Goncourt (one of these awards pseudonymous, the result of his having gleefully tricked the critics), hero of the Republic, valorous recipient of the Croix de Guerre, diplomat, bon vivant, womanizer par excellence—went home to his apartment on the rue du Bac and put a bullet through his brain.
</li><li>It’s quite natural that the people closest to suicide victims so frequently and feverishly hasten to disclaim the truth; the sense of implication, of personal guilt—the idea that one might have prevented the act if one had taken certain precautions, had somehow behaved differently—is perhaps inevitable. Even so, the sufferer—whether he has actually killed himself or attempted to do so, or merely expressed threats—is often, through denial on the part of others, unjustly made to appear a wrongdoer.
</li><li>A similar case is that of Randall Jarrell—one of the fine poets and critics of his generation—who on a night in 1965, near Chapel Hill, North Carolina, was struck by a car and killed. Jarrell’s presence on that particular stretch of road, at an odd hour of the evening, was puzzling, and since some of the indications were that he had deliberately let the car strike him, the early conclusion was that his death was suicide.
</li><li>Despite depression’s eclectic reach, it has been demonstrated with fair convincingness that artistic types (especially poets) are particularly vulnerable to the disorder—which, in its graver, clinical manifestation takes upward of twenty percent of its victims by way of suicide.
</li><li>“Melancholia” would still appear to be a far more apt and evocative word for the blacker forms of the disorder, but it was usurped by a noun with a bland tonality and lacking any magisterial presence, used indifferently to describe an economic decline or a rut in the ground, a true wimp of a word for such a major illness.
</li><li>“Brainstorm,” for instance, has unfortunately been preempted to describe, somewhat jocularly, intellectual inspiration. But something along these lines is needed. Told that someone’s mood disorder has evolved into a storm—a veritable howling tempest in the brain, which is indeed what a clinical depression resembles like nothing else—even the uninformed layman might display sympathy rather than the standard reaction that “depression” evokes, something akin to “So what?” or “You’ll pull out of it” or “We all have bad days.”
</li><li>I shall never learn what “caused” my depression, as no one will ever learn about their own. To be able to do so will likely forever prove to be an impossibility, so complex are the intermingled factors of abnormal chemistry, behavior and genetics. Plainly, multiple components are involved—perhaps three or four, most probably more, in fathomless permutations. That is why the greatest fallacy about suicide lies in the belief that there is a single immediate answer—or perhaps combined answers—as to why the deed was done.
</li><li>It has been established with reasonable certainty (after strong resistance from many psychiatrists, and not all that long ago) that such madness is chemically induced amid the neurotransmitters of the brain, probably as the result of systemic stress, which for unknown reasons causes a depletion of the chemicals norepinephrine and serotonin, and the increase of a hormone, cortisol.
</li><li>I began to conceive that my mind itself was like one of those outmoded small-town telephone exchanges, being gradually inundated by flood-waters: one by one, the normal circuits began to drown, causing some of the functions of the body and nearly all of those of instinct and intellect to slowly disconnect.
</li><li>He asked me if I was suicidal, and I reluctantly told him yes. I did not particularize—since there seemed no need to—did not tell him that in truth many of the artifacts of my house had become potential devices for my own destruction: the attic rafters (and an outside maple or two) a means to hang myself, the garage a place to inhale carbon monoxide, the bathtub a vessel to receive the flow from my opened arteries. The kitchen knives in their drawers had but one purpose for me. Death by heart attack seemed particularly inviting, absolving me as it would of active responsibility, and I had toyed with the idea of self-induced pneumonia—a long, frigid, shirt-sleeved hike through the rainy woods. Nor had I overlooked an ostensible accident, à la Randall Jarrell, by walking in front of a truck on the highway nearby. These thoughts may seem outlandishly macabre—a strained joke—but they are genuine. They are doubtless especially repugnant to healthy Americans, with their faith in self-improvement. Yet in truth such hideous fantasies, which cause well people to shudder, are to the deeply depressed mind what lascivious daydreams are to persons of robust sexuality.
</li><li>Loss in all of its manifestations is the touchstone of depression—in the progress of the disease and, most likely, in its origin.
</li><li>One develops fierce attachments. Ludicrous things—my reading glasses, a handkerchief, a certain writing instrument—became the objects of my demented possessiveness. Each momentary misplacement filled me with a frenzied dismay, each item being the tactile reminder of a world soon to be obliterated.
</li><li>A phenomenon that a number of people have noted while in deep depression is the sense of being accompanied by a second self—a wraithlike observer who, not sharing the dementia of his double, is able to watch with dispassionate curiosity as his companion struggles against the oncoming disaster, or decides to embrace it. There is a theatrical quality about all this, and during the next several days, as I went about stolidly preparing for extinction, I couldn’t shake off a sense of melodrama—a melodrama in which I, the victim-to-be of self-murder, was both the solitary actor and lone member of the audience.
</li><li>ECT, electroconvulsive therapy—shock treatment, as it is better known. In many cases this is an effective remedy—it has undergone improvement and has made a respectable comeback, generally shedding the medieval disrepute into which it was once cast—but it is plainly a drastic procedure one would want to avoid.
</li><li>Much evidence has accumulated recently that indicts Halcion (whose chemical name is triazolam) as a causative factor in producing suicidal obsession and other aberrations of thought in susceptible individuals.
</li><li>It is of great importance that those who are suffering a siege, perhaps for the first time, be told—be convinced, rather—that the illness will run its course and that they will pull through.
</li><li>Suicide has been a persistent theme in my books—three of my major characters killed themselves.
</li><li>While Lincoln’s hectic moods of melancholy are legend, it is much less well known that in his youth he was often in a suicidal turmoil and came close more than once to making an attempt on his own life.
</li><li>In an illuminating new book on suicide, Self-Destruction in the Promised Land, Howard I. Kushner,
</li><li>In the middle of the journey of our life I found myself in a dark wood, For I had lost the right path.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Saturday, April 22, 2023 9:00:09 PM
</h4><ul><li>When I’m alone, I realize I’m with the person who tried to kill me. —JOHN MULANEY
</li><li>And that’s one of the reasons I wrote this book: I believe that for the vast majority of people, suicide is a bad choice.
</li><li>I believe that the drive to self-annihilation is one that we all share. It expresses itself in many different ways: in attempts to escape yourself and avoid your problems, by overwork or Instagram scrolling or buying things or staying in expensive hotels; obviously, in addiction and related extreme behaviors; and in the thought, desire, or attempt to kill oneself. The drive to self-annihilation—the death drive—might be as primitive and fundamental to our psychology as the sex drive.
</li><li>As Nietzsche observed, a thought comes when it will, not when I will.
</li><li>When the world refuses to conform to the way I insist it ought to be, or more often, when I fail to live up to some standard I’ve set for myself, I freak out and go into fight-or-flight thinking, which in my experience is the seed around which the crystal of a suicide attempt can form.
</li><li>As I like to tell people who come to me in crisis, if it ever gets so bad that I simply can’t take it anymore, I can always just kill myself tomorrow.
</li><li>And if you want to kill yourself, don’t use pills. Nobody dies from overdosing on pills anymore.”
</li><li>I knew the book he meant. It’s called Final Exit. I don’t recommend it.
</li><li>This was how I thought at that time. Everything was one second to the next. I truly couldn’t conceive of tomorrow. Things just happened, and they were either good or bad, and I wanted to get away from the bad things and stumble into the good things. Or if there were no good things to discover, I wanted to commit suicide to get away altogether.
</li><li>At least since Saint Augustine came out against it in the fifth century (motivated in part by early Christian groups who believed that one could get into heaven more quickly by killing oneself while still sinless), an enormous variety of social and legal condemnations of suicide have dominated Western culture.
</li><li>For years, it was dogma among psychiatrists that young children did not attempt suicide. But the truth is that for many people, including me, the desire to end their own life is among their earliest memories.
</li><li>My students tend to be smarter, more intimate, and more involved if I get them outside. Something about sitting in the grass in the open air makes it easier to think in original ways.
</li><li>How could a two-year-old wish he were dead? It’s a reasonable question. One answer comes from the Tibetan Buddhist lama Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche, who wrote that suicide is simply a pattern we are repeating from past lives. “Suicide is a habit we pick up very quickly and is extremely difficult to break. It’s a little like being addicted to alcohol and incapable of saying no to a drink. Habit plays a huge role in defining future rebirths. Once you have formed the habit of ending your life when things get tough, you will resort to suicide more and more quickly in your future lives.”
</li><li>It can be helpful to remember that suicide seems to run in families. These families may well be dysfunctional, like my own, but strong evidence suggests that genetic factors also contribute to the likelihood of a suicide attempt.
</li><li>Probably the greatest philosopher of the twentieth century, Ludwig Wittgenstein, had an interesting family. Three of his four brothers committed suicide, and Wittgenstein himself constantly battled the desire to kill himself.
</li><li>I am slowly learning that trying to control how I feel is a lot like trying to control how the people around me feel: utterly useless and counterproductive. I have to liberate myself from the idea that I have control. I also have to learn how to let myself feel pain.
</li><li>Yiyun Li wrote, “One’s wish to die can be as blind and intuitive as one’s will to live, yet the latter is never questioned.”
</li><li>“I made my first suicide attempt at the age of fourteen,” the Canadian novelist Nelly Arcan wrote in her novel Exit, which she finished a few weeks before she killed herself.
</li><li>Mahatma Gandhi, who attempted suicide in his youth by taking dathura (jimson weed) seeds with a friend,
</li><li>If I have one crucially important piece of advice to offer in this book, among all its many practical recommendations about living as, or with, a suicidal person, it’s this: absolutely do not keep a gun in the house. If you have one, get rid of it immediately.
</li><li>The states that have the lowest percentage of gun ownership and strictest gun laws, like California and New York, also have the lowest rates of death by suicide.
</li><li>On this subject Freud wrote: Is it not for us to confess that in our civilized attitude towards death we are once more living psychologically beyond our means, and must reform and give truth its due? Would it not be better to give death the place in actuality and in our thoughts which properly belongs to it, and to yield a little more prominence to that unconscious attitude towards death which we have hitherto so carefully suppressed?
</li><li>Death by despair or parasuicidal behavior: these terms refer, generally, to a person who doesn’t attempt one specific act designed to end her life—such as hanging herself from a belt in the bathroom, for instance—but consistently and repeatedly engages in conduct that will likely hasten her death, sometimes by quite a lot.
</li><li>He once remarked that he was not the sort of person who should ever own a home, that he was someone who always ought to rent. As soon as I read that, I thought, Oh yes, I recognize you, I know exactly what you mean. It reminded me of the great writer Stefan Zweig, who killed himself along with his wife Lotte in a suicide pact: “A friend once remarked that, no matter where you met Zweig, his manner suggested a half-packed suitcase in the next room.”
</li><li>According to data from a 2015 study, men over 65 were the most likely to die of suicide (27.67 suicides per 100,000), closely followed by men aged 40 to 64 (27.10 suicides per 100,000), with the number dropping fairly significantly with men aged 20 to 39 (23.41 per 100,000), and happily much lower yet with boys aged 15 to 19 (13.81 per 100,000).
</li><li>“I believe that suicide is a natural history, a disease process, not an act or a choice, a decision or a wish.”
</li><li>Charles Bukowski once remarked that the mere thought of having to get out of bed every morning and tie your shoelaces and brush your teeth was more than enough to drive any reasonable person to the brink of suicide.
</li><li>Anthony Bourdain remarked, “I will find myself in an airport, for instance, and I’ll order an airport hamburger. It’s an insignificant thing, it’s a small thing, it’s a hamburger, but it’s not a good one. Suddenly I look at that hamburger and I find myself in a spiral of depression that can last for days.”
</li><li>Dese’Rae L. Stage, a suicide survivor and contemporary expert on suicide, whose website LiveThroughThis.org and podcast Suicide-n-Stuff.com I heartily recommend.
</li><li>To quote again from The Sorrows of Young Werther, “It is in vain that a man of sound mind and cool temper understands the condition of such a wretched being, in vain he counsels him. He can no more communicate his own wisdom to him than a healthy man can instill his strength into the invalid, by whose bedside he is seated.”
</li><li>Almost every expert on suicide agrees on one thing: that if possible, you should get the suicidal person to talk about whatever is going on by asking direct, specific, and fearless questions. If a person will tell you what’s going on with her when she’s about to kill herself, she is more likely to find the emotional space not to act on the desire.
</li><li>James Hillman’s Suicide and the Soul (1973), one of the best books written on suicide,
</li><li>He gave me the enduring conviction that what matters most about human life is the investigation of its meaning, which is why I became a philosophy professor, a job I love.
</li><li>A statistic that always startles me is that about 25 percent of all chronic alcohol and drug users kill themselves.
</li><li>In Fingarette’s account, the label alcoholic can excuse behavior (“I can’t help it, I’m an alcoholic, my life is unmanageable”). It may interfere with recovery (“I have to quit cold turkey: I’m addicted, I’m an alcoholic”). It has a social stigma (“Poor bastard. He’s not just a real drinker, he’s an alcoholic”). And it creates a self-fulfilling prophecy (“Because I am an alcoholic, my life will always be determined by the stalwart, morally praiseworthy denial or the disastrous, perverse acceptance of this drug”).
</li><li>In her memoir about her suicide attempts Yiyun Li controversially wrote that “one never kills oneself from knowledge or understanding, but always out of feelings.”
</li><li>The great writer on depression Andrew Solomon puts the hope this way: “the more fully one comes to terms with the idea of rational suicide, the safer one will be from irrational suicide.”
</li><li>As Socrates famously says about death in The Apology, when confronting his own death sentence: Now if you suppose that there is no consciousness, but a sleep like the sleep of him who is undisturbed even by dreams, death will be an unspeakable gain. For if a person were to select the night in which his sleep was undisturbed even by dreams, and were to compare with this the other days and nights of his life, and then were to tell us how many days and nights he had passed in the course of his life better and more pleasantly than this one, I think that any man, I will not say a private man, but even the great king will not find many such days or nights, when compared with the others. Now if death be of such a nature, I say that to die is gain; for eternity is then only a single night.
</li><li>On Suicide: A Discourse on Voluntary Death.
</li><li>Suicide, Améry argues, is the only thing one can do when one is no longer capable of being oneself—by which he means, when the suffering of being oneself is simply unbearable.
</li><li>In many African origin myths, we find the belief that the gods created death itself because human beings found life so difficult that they requested an end to it.
</li><li>“You directed at yourself a violence that you did not feel toward others.” I’ve often asked my students, “Imagine what your life would be like if you had the same contempt for others that you have for yourself.”
</li><li>In some ways, suicide is the most selfish act one can perform—it is a way of taking something that belongs to many people and making it yours alone. It’s burning down a house in which many people live, just because you don’t want to live there anymore.
</li><li>This feeling leads him to what he calls the fraudulence paradox, which, along with suicide, is the theme of the story: “the more time and effort you put into trying to appear impressive or attractive to other people, the less impressive or attractive you felt inside—you were a fraud. And the more of a fraud you felt like, the harder you tried to convey an impressive or likable image of yourself so that other people wouldn’t find out what a hollow, fraudulent person you really were.” About this passage, Adrienne Miller comments that the fraudulence paradox was one of the many gothic cul-de-sacs of thought he got himself entombed in. David would often say harrowing things to me like “I’ve never had one honest moment in my life.” He’d say that all of his relationships had been fake and that he’d been “performing” in them. I’m sure it’s very crude and too simplistic to put it this way, but since he seemed to have this idea he was a kind of con man (another of his favorite terms to describe himself), he believed himself to be unworthy of happiness. I know in my own experience with him, he certainly believed he was undeserving of a functional, emotionally healthy, loving relationship. I remember imploring him once to please try to accept any happiness that came his way, and he said, “Don’t you understand? I can’t.” So of course we’re not saying anything about David that he didn’t understand about himself, or that he didn’t think about ten thousand times more deeply than anyone else ever could have. These days we often refer to this problem as the imposter syndrome, and in the popular and psychological literature on the subject, Wallace’s name tends to come up as a prime case because he frequently remarked that he felt like a big phony. Yet we can all agree that he very much deserved his prizes, his fame, and his enormous literary reputation. But as Miller points out, Wallace puts his particularly dark spin on the imposter syndrome, binding it to an inability to be happy, the emotional expression of a fundamental irreconcilability of himself with himself. “I’d been fraudulent even in my pursuit of ways to achieve genuine uncalculating integrity,” he tells us, before giving us the long list of all the various self-help, religious, athletic, and other techniques he used to attempt to escape from his feeling of being a fake. His attempts were obviously paradoxical: one doesn’t escape the feeling of not-being-oneself by attempting to change oneself into what-one-is-not. The challenge, as Nietzsche put it in a paradoxical formulation, is rather “How one becomes what one is.” Suppose you are impressed by people, especially other artists and writers, who have despaired and killed themselves because of it. How are you going to live up to their image? By committing suicide yourself. But at the same time you recognize that being impressed by those artists and writers who killed themselves is itself a form of posturing, a fraudulence and inauthenticity, because they killed themselves for reasons of their own—out of sincerely desperate circumstances—not merely in imitation of other artists who killed themselves. How do you prove to yourself that you aren’t a fraud or an imposter who is merely being impressed by other famous suicides of the past? Well, the only way to do that is to actually kill yourself—that is, to show you’re not a poser who just thinks suicide is cool because cool people have done it. You’re a “real” suicide person, someone who must kill himself. But then you will have killed yourself in an attempt to prove to yourself that you’re not an imposter on the basis of the fear of being an imposter in wanting to kill yourself. This vertiginous, paradoxical logic naturally only adds to the misery and feelings of fraudulence of the person bound up in it. I shouldn’t exclude myself here. This entire book could be nothing more than my own posturing at seeming like someone who is trying to escape from his suicidality, or deeper, like someone who is sincerely suicidal despite his many failed attempts, or still worse, like someone who feels that suicide is eluding him and he is trying to find his way further into the possibility of it. And all these may contain layers upon layers of imposture and fraudulence, and I’ll never know—though like Wallace’s narrator in the story (and like Wallace himself?), there is one way out of the fraudulence: killing myself. But what if that final act is simply the greatest piece of fraudulence yet? And now I’ve died as a fraud to prove that I wasn’t a fraud in the one thing about which I was most fraudulent. (This may still seem a bit unclear. Let me walk you through the steps. Step one: I want to kill myself. Step two: But why? It might be because my heroes killed themselves. Step three: But that’s a bullshit reason to kill yourself, just copying your heroes. Fine to copy them in other things, but pathetic to kill yourself for that reason. Step four: Also, I’ve failed at suicide, and now other people doubt the sincerity of my wanting to kill myself. They recognize that I’m just doing it because I want to be cool, like my heroes. Step five: But I still want to kill myself and to prove to other people that my desire to die is sincere. Step six: Try again to kill yourself. But step seven: Isn’t this insincerity all the way down? Doesn’t that leave me killing myself insincerely only to prove that I was sincere? Step eight: Stop waffling. That’s the very proof of your insincerity. Just kill yourself and be done with it.) Wallace’s hero recognizes the corner he’s painted himself into, commenting, in what may be one of the most devastatingly sad and yet still optimistic lines in the whole history of the literature on suicide, “So cry all you want. I won’t tell anybody. But it wouldn’t have made you a fraud to change your mind. It would be sad to do it because you think you somehow have to.” He knows this—or is willing to admit it—and yet he doesn’t change his mind. The one thing Wallace’s hero never tries, unfortunately, is just accepting the fact that he’s a fake and admitting to himself that maybe other people are fakes too—some with lesser, some with greater success at fakery than his own—which would be a scary step in the direction of realizing that there was nothing fake or exceptional about his fakery, which would be a second scary step toward admitting that he wasn’t really so special or unusual, he was just another human being wrestling with the very ordinary human pressure of trying and failing to live up to his own expectations and the expectations of others. What if he just gave up on those expectations? The narrator never considers it. He doesn’t seem capable of it. Now, Wallace the author is acutely aware of this failing of his narrator. In his commencement speech “This Is Water,” he went out of his way to say that the problem of thinking you alone matter and forgetting that others matter at least as much or even more than you do is the central psychological difficulty of existence. In “Good Old Neon,” the hero is trying to show us how being addicted to this thought, and the way it twists the course of one’s thinking into endless self-referential misery, will lead (paradoxically—the whole story is deliberately full of paradoxes, and includes an explanation of a famous mathematical paradox) to self-destruction. Because Wallace did in fact kill himself six years after publishing this story, we might think that he hadn’t been able to see his way out of this problem of self-aggrandizement. But that’s not at all the case. He understood very well what his problem was—or what one aspect of his problem was, the aspect he was particularly concerned with in this story—but that didn’t mean he could solve the problem. A successful cure doesn’t necessarily follow from an accurate diagnosis. In fact, in the text he offers a solution to his own problem, when the psychiatrist suggests that he try to think of the world and himself in a less clichéd way. The clichés he suffers from, his psychiatrist insists, include the idea that he understands his life and his way of interacting with others in terms of “competitiveness instead of concert.” Now, the narrator is not in a position to understand his psychiatrist’s advice, having concluded that the man was incapable of helping him: “By this point in the analysis I’d pretty much decided he was an idiot.” But this is at the heart of his problem: if he could
</li><li>This feeling leads him to what he calls the fraudulence paradox, which, along with suicide, is the theme of the story: “the more time and effort you put into trying to appear impressive or attractive to other people, the less impressive or attractive you felt inside—you were a fraud. And the more of a fraud you felt like, the harder you tried to convey an impressive or likable image of yourself so that other people wouldn’t find out what a hollow, fraudulent person you really were.”

</li><li>Lately I’ve been thinking a lot about the advice of that woman with the cane at the AA meeting who told me that she had relapsed plenty of times in her life, and had stopped marking her sober days and her relapses, and had learned to just be glad about the days she was sober.

And yet it will soon be so still for all these shouting, lively, life-loving people! How everyone’s shadow, his gloomy travelling companion stands behind him! It is always as in the last moment before the departure of an emigrant ship: people have more than ever to say to one another, the hour presses, the ocean with its lonely silence waits impatiently behind all the noise—so greedy, so certain of its prey! And all, all, suppose that the past has been nothing, or a small matter, that the near future is everything: hence this haste, this crying, this self-deafening and self-overreaching! Everyone wants to be foremost in this future—and yet death and the stillness of death are the only things certain and common to all in this future! How strange that this sole thing that is certain and common to all, exercises almost no influence on men, and that they are the furthest from regarding themselves as the brotherhood of death! It makes me happy to see that men do not want to think at all of the idea of death! I want to do something to make the idea of life even a hundred times more worthy of their attention.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Monday, April 24, 2023 8:19:33 PM
</h4><ul><li>And in the United States, once people are earning around $75,000 per year, making more money has no impact at all on their day-to-day feelings of happiness.
</li><li>In a carefully controlled study of more than six hundred women in Ohio, homeowners weren’t any happier than renters, though they were about twelve pounds heavier.
</li><li>But because experiences often elude easy comparisons, experiential purchases seem to inoculate us against the pernicious negative emotion of regret. As researchers Travis Carter and Tom Gilovich explain, “It is a relatively straightforward task to align the size, picture quality and cost of several televisions before deciding which has the best combination of features. Choosing a dessert by comparing the taste and texture of an apple tart to that of an orange sorbet is considerably more difficult; one must literally compare apples to oranges.”
</li><li>Remarkably, though, the length of an experience has little impact on the pleasure people remember deriving from it.35
</li><li>So, driving a BMW probably won’t provide you with any more pleasure than driving a Ford Escort—except on those rare occasions when your attention turns to the car itself, whether directed by a question from a researcher or a joy ride on a winding mountain road.
</li><li>According to our favorite Portuguese saying, “You should never have a yacht; you should have a friend with a yacht.”
</li><li>But research suggests that people with more money do not spend their time in more enjoyable ways on a day-to-day basis.2 Wealthier individuals tend to spend more of their time on activities associated with relatively high levels of tension and stress, such as shopping, working, and commuting.
</li><li>Although vacuuming seems like a fairly trivial hassle, research suggests that daily hassles exert a remarkable downward force on our happiness. One study of a hundred adults in the San Francisco Bay area showed that psychological distress over a nine-month period was predicted less by major life events than by day-to-day hassles, ranging from “sexual problems” to “troublesome neighbors” to “filling out forms”
</li><li>When people engage in volunteer work, even for as little as fifteen minutes, they feel that they have more free time in their lives.
</li><li>Rather than taking a higher-paying job farther from home and using the extra money to buy a nice car, most people would be better off sticking with a job closer to home, even if it pays less.
</li><li>In addition to spending two weeks per year commuting, the average American spends the equivalent of two months per year watching television.
</li><li>Faced with a decision between multiple products that differ in their features and price tags, ask yourself whether the differences in features will alter how you spend your time. If the answer is no, go cheap.
</li><li>we suggest a simple exercise before making a major purchase: Think about Tuesday. Take the time to consider what you’ll be doing from morning to night this coming Tuesday. How will the purchase affect you on Tuesday? This simple exercise—thinking about time use on a specific day—helps us make less biased predictions about how much any one thing will influence our happiness.
</li><li>Potential donors contribute more time and more money to charity when they’re first asked about their willingness to donate time.68 Thinking about time makes people focus on the warm glow of giving to others, propelling them to help out however they can. It also increases the appeal of experiential purchases.
</li><li>When people see time as money, they find it difficult to reap joy from the unpaid pleasures of daily life.
</li><li>The French use the verb se réjouir to capture the experience of deriving pleasure in the present from anticipating the future.
</li><li>In a study of more than one thousand people in the Netherlands, vacationers exhibited a bigger happiness boost in the weeks before their trip, rather than in the weeks afterward.
</li><li>When students had the opportunity to bid on a pair of tickets to a sold out sporting event, those told they would have to pay with cash by the next day bid an average of $28 for the tickets. Their peers who used credit cards bid an average of $60.38 These students were not financially naïve freshmen, but rather MBA students who should have known better than to pay a 100 percent premium for the privilege of using credit rather than cash.
</li><li>Although the relationship between income and happiness is fairly weak among Americans, there is a much stronger relationship between individuals’ happiness and whether they have difficulty paying their bills.43 In other words, what we owe is a bigger predictor of our happiness than what we make.
</li><li>In a representative sample of more than six hundred Americans, personal spending accounted for the lion’s share of most people’s budgets.3 The average ratio of personal to prosocial spending was more than 10 to 1. But the amount of money individuals devoted to themselves was unrelated to their overall happiness. What did predict happiness? The amount of money they gave away. The more they invested in others, the happier they were. This relationship between prosocial spending and happiness held up even after taking into account individuals’ income. Amazingly, the effect of this single spending category was as large as the effect of income in predicting happiness.
</li><li>three strategies designed to boost the impact of investing in others: Make It a Choice, Make a Connection, and Make an Impact.
</li><li>Students reported feeling better on days when they did something prosocial, but only when their actions felt self-chosen. If students helped because they felt like they had to or because people would be mad otherwise, they felt worse on days when they did good things.
</li><li>At the store, she paid the layaway orders for as many as fifty random strangers. As a final gesture, she handed out $50 bills while leaving the store.
</li><li>In other words, whether countries were rich or poor, their inhabitants’ happiness depended on the relative disparities in their incomes.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Tuesday, April 25, 2023 8:26:33 PM
</h4><ul><li>In 2010, 49% of Republicans and 33% of Democrats in the United States reported that they would be displeased if their child married outside of their political party, whereas less than 5% of both parties had said this in 1960.9 Polarized politics has infected personal relations.
</li><li>Interruption is a paradigm of incivility because it sends the signal that I do not want to listen to you or at least that what you say is less valuable than what I say. Civility, thus, requires the virtue of patience while we wait for our audiences as they take time to speak their minds.
</li><li>The real goal of such jokes, I suspect, is to build group solidarity. Making fun of opponents is rewarded by laughter and praise from like-minded audiences who agree with us. This reaction signals to us all that we share certain values, which motivates us to hang together as a group or as a movement. Joking about a view also shows that we do not take it seriously, so we are unlikely to be swayed onto that opposing side. That signals our stability, which gives people confidence in cooperating with us. Finally, the ability to make the best joke at opponents’ expense also gains us status as a leader in the group. That is why some members of the group compete to tell the funniest or most vicious joke at the expense of outsiders.
</li><li>And racism is defined by regarding or treating races differently when there is no reason to do so. It is not racist to treat people from other racial backgrounds differently when there is good reason for differential treatment, such as in testing for sickle-cell anemia, which is almost exclusively confined to people of African heritage.
</li><li>Cynicism results from unrealistic expectations. If we expect an argument to be a knock-down proof that convinces everyone immediately on first hearing, then we are bound to be disappointed. Almost no arguments work like that. If we trim our expectations to make them more realistic, and if we are patient enough to wait for effects that take a while instead of demanding immediate capitulation, then we will find that reasons and arguments can have some influence.
</li><li>To ask “Why do you want to turn right?” is to show a recognition that I am the kind of creature who can give a reason. It is a sign of respect.
</li><li>“Contrary to common bleak assessments of human reasoning abilities, people are quite capable of reasoning in an unbiased manner, at least when they are evaluating arguments rather than producing them, and when they are after the truth instead of trying to win a debate.”
</li><li>“An argument is a connected series of statements intended to present a reason for a proposition.”
</li><li>This problem generalizes to all beliefs, according to philosophical skeptics.2 They assume that every premise needs to be justified by some evidence, that evidence can always be put into some kind of argument, that every argument needs premises, and that an argument cannot make its conclusion justified unless its premises are justified. These plausible principles together generate an infinite regress: premises need justification that needs more premises that need more justification that needs more premises that need more justification, and so on forever. If there is no escape from this regress, then how could anyone ever be justified in believing anything?
</li><li>A sound argument is defined as an argument that both is valid and also has all true premises. This definition guarantees that every sound argument has a true conclusion.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Tuesday, April 25, 2023 11:04:41 PM
</h4><ul><li>The first great work of human literature, the four-thousand-year-old The Epic of Gilgamesh, is about a hero’s quest to figure out how he should live knowing that he will die.
</li><li>In the late sixties, the top priority of college freshmen was “developing a meaningful life philosophy.” Nearly all of them—86 percent—said this was an “essential” or “very important” life goal. By the 2000s, their top priority became “being very well off financially” while just 40 percent said meaning was their chief goal.
</li><li>According to Psychology Today, in 2000, the number of books published about happiness was a modest fifty. In 2008, that number had skyrocketed to 4,000.
</li><li>“The more directly one aims to maximize pleasure and avoid pain, the more likely one is to produce instead a life bereft of depth, meaning, and community.”
</li><li>The philosopher John Stuart Mill wouldn’t have been surprised. “Those only are happy,” he wrote, “who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness; on the happiness of others, on the improvement of mankind, even on some art or pursuit, followed not as a means, but as itself an ideal end. Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness by the way.”
</li><li>In the United States, the rate of people suffering from depression has risen dramatically since 1960, and between 1988 and 2008 the use of antidepressants rose 400 percent. These figures can’t just be attributed to the increasing availability of mental health care. According to the World Health Organization, global suicide rates have spiked 60 percent since World War II.
</li><li>Wealthy places like France and Hong Kong had some of the lowest levels of meaning, while the poor nations of Togo and Niger had among the highest, even though people living there were some of the unhappiest in the study.
</li><li>When they crunched the numbers, they discovered a striking trend: happiness and unhappiness did not predict suicide. The variable that did, they found, was meaning—or, more precisely, the lack of it. The countries with the lowest rates of meaning, like Japan, also had some of the highest suicide rates.
</li><li>By the time he returned to school, Camus had decided that life had no meaning, a position he expressed in an autobiographical story published in a literary journal called Sud: “I haven’t got anything anymore, I don’t believe in anything, and it’s impossible to live like this, having killed morality inside me. I have no more purpose, no more reason to live, and I will die.”
</li><li>Like all great comedians, C.K. is a philosopher masquerading as a funny man: “Underneath everything in your life,” he told O’Brien, “there is that thing, that empty—forever empty. That knowledge that it’s all for nothing and that you’re alone. It’s down there. And sometimes when things clear away, you’re not watching anything, you’re in your car, and you start going, ‘Oh no, here it comes. That I’m alone.’ It starts to visit on you. Just this sadness. Life is tremendously sad, just by being in it.”
</li><li>“Oh my soul, do not aspire to immortal life, but exhaust the limits of the possible.”
</li><li>Owen C. Middleton, who was serving a life term in prison, found meaning in simply being part of the world: “I do not know to what great end Destiny leads us, nor do I care very much. Long before that end, I shall have played my part, spoken my lines, and passed on. How I play that part is all that concerns me. In the knowledge that I am an inalienable part of this great, wonderful, upward movement called life, and that nothing, neither pestilence, nor physical affliction, nor depression—nor prison—can take away from me my part, lies my consolation, my inspiration, and my treasure.”
</li><li>“Voltaire once remarked,” he writes, “that he might occasionally have killed himself, had he not had so much work on his hands.”
</li><li>“It’s those conversations that are trivial and don’t mean much that you miss—the daily stuff, not the big stuff.
</li><li>In the early twentieth century, the mortality rate for children in orphanages could approach 100 percent—that is, almost every single child in the orphanage died before they were one or two years old.
</li><li>In 1985, when the General Social Survey asked Americans how many people they’d discussed important matters with over the last six months, the most common response was three. When the survey was given again in 2004, the most common response was zero.
</li><li>One of them said to him, “You know, James, if you ever left this earth, that would make all of us here very unhappy.” It was a simple statement—a small gesture of support. But James carries it with him. When he starts to doubt whether his life is worth living, he brings that memory to the front of his mind, and it brings him comfort, reminding him that he is cared for.
</li><li>“I did the wrong thing,” Jonathan later said. “I didn’t accept his kindness. He wanted to do something meaningful, but I treated it as a transaction.”
</li><li>We can’t control whether someone will make a high quality connection with us, but we can all choose to initiate or reciprocate one. We can decide to respond kindly, rather than antagonistically, to an annoying colleague. We can say hello to a stranger on the street rather than avert our eyes. We can choose to value people rather than devalue them. We can invite people to belong.
</li><li>Approaching a tiny village, the Buddha grew frail and weak. When he arrived, a local blacksmith named Cunda, in a gesture of devotion and hospitality, offered him a meal that, the story goes, the Buddha knew was spoiled. The Buddha, however, did not want to hurt Cunda by rejecting the kind and generous offer of food. So he ate the food, even though he knew he would fall ill. “And soon after the Blessed One had eaten the meal provided by Cunda the metalworker,” we learn, “a dire sickness fell upon him, even dysentery, and he suffered sharp and deadly pains.”
</li><li>Researchers at Texas A&M University have examined the tight relationship between identity and purpose, and they’ve found that knowing oneself is one of the most important predictors of meaning in life.
</li><li>The four most common occupations in America are retail salesperson, cashier, food preparer and server, and office clerk, low-paying and often rote jobs that don’t scream “meaningful work”—at least not on their face.
</li><li>Grant points out that those who consistently rank their jobs as meaningful have something in common: they see their jobs as a way to help others. In a survey of over 2 million individuals across over 500 different jobs, those who reported finding the most meaning in their careers were clergy, English teachers, surgeons, directors of activities and education at religious organizations, elementary and secondary school administrators, radiation therapists, chiropractors, and psychiatrists. These jobs, Grant writes, “are all service jobs. Surgeons and chiropractors promote physical health. Clergy and religious directors promote spiritual health. Educators promote social and mental health. If these jobs didn’t exist, other people would be worse off.”
</li><li>“The growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.”
</li><li>It’s important to understand that an individual’s life story is not an exhaustive history of what happened to him. Rather, we make what McAdams calls “narrative choices.” Our stories tend to focus on the most extraordinary events of our lives, good and bad, because those are the experiences that we need to make sense of, those are the experiences that shape us. But our interpretations of those events may differ wildly. For one person, for example, a pivotal childhood experience like learning how to swim by being thrown into the water by a parent might explain his sense of himself today as a hardy entrepreneur who learns best by taking risks. For another, that same experience might explain why he hates boats and does not trust authority figures. A third might leave the experience out of his story altogether, deeming it unimportant in the larger narrative of his life.
</li><li>People who are driven to contribute to society and to future generations, he found, all share a common pattern: they are more likely to tell redemptive stories about their lives, or stories that transition from bad to good. In these stories, the tellers move from suffering to salvation—they experience a negative event followed by a positive event that resulted from the negative event and therefore gives their suffering some meaning.
</li><li>People who tell contamination stories, McAdams has found, are less “generative,” as psychologists put it, or less driven to contribute to society and younger generations. They also tend to be more anxious and depressed, and to feel that their lives are less coherent compared to those who tell redemptive stories.
</li><li>The psychologist Michele Crossley writes that mental illness is often the result of a person’s inability to tell a good story about his or her life. Either the story is incoherent or inadequate, or it’s a “life story gone awry.”
</li><li>Waiting for Snow in Havana,
</li><li>“I don’t know if it’s possible to think of future nostalgia,” he said. “But I do sometimes get nostalgic for the future I could have had. What would my life have been like? What kind of person would I have been? What would my relationship to my father have been like? I wouldn’t have had this total break between my childhood and adulthood. I would have had a seamless life.”
</li><li>By sharing their stories with the audience, storytellers aren’t just creating meaning for themselves—they’re helping others do so, too. “And that’s why storytelling is so important,” continued Crabb. “I think some people think it’s all about talking about you, you, you. But what it really is is reaching out into the void and connecting with people and letting them know they’re not alone.”
</li><li>Most of the stars we saw were hundreds of millions of years old and dozens of light-years away—and some were much farther. Looking at them means looking back in time: because they are so distant from Earth, it takes many years for the light they emit to finally reach our eyes, which means that when we see stars in the sky, we are seeing them as they existed years ago. Even Alpha Centauri, the nearest star to our own solar system, is 26 trillion miles away from us; when it one day burns up and dies, observers on Earth (assuming there are any) will only find out four and a half years after the fact.
</li><li>During transcendent states, two remarkable things happen. According to psychologist David Yaden of the University of Pennsylvania, an expert on transcendence, first, our sense of self washes away along with all of its petty concerns and desires. We then feel deeply connected to other people and everything else that exists in the world. The result is that our anxieties about existence and death evaporate, and life finally seems, for a moment, to make sense—which leaves us with a sense of peace and well-being.
</li><li>“To see the earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together, brothers on that bright loveliness in the eternal cold—brothers who know now they are truly brothers.”
</li><li>Blue Origin, founded by Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon.com.
</li><li>“If you hold the strong materialistic worldview that everything ends with the body’s death, with no meaning or hope beyond that,” Griffiths explained, “then death seems like a pretty dismal prospect.” But, he added, if “you have an experience of transcendence, when one has a sense of the interconnectedness of all things and a stunning appreciation of life and consciousness, whether or not you come out believing in heaven or karma or an afterlife, you can recognize the depth of our ignorance in the astounding mystery of what it is to be alive and aware.”
</li><li>Does a cloud that disappears from the sky die? “Sooner or later,” writes the Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh, “the cloud will change into rain or snow or ice. If you look deeply into the rain, you can see the cloud. The cloud is not lost; it is transformed into rain, and the rain is transformed into grass and the grass into cows and then to milk and then into the ice cream you eat.”
</li><li>“Service is the only thing that makes sense after what happened,” he said. “I can’t undo time, but I can make a difference, and that’s what drives me forward. When a vet tells me of the difference Dryhootch made in his life, that’s when it all comes together.”
</li><li>But researchers have found that anywhere from half to two-thirds of trauma survivors report post-traumatic growth, while only a small percentage suffer from PTSD.
</li><li>Just as a city has a certain structure before a major earthquake, so too do we have certain fundamental beliefs about our lives and the world. Trauma shatters those assumptions. But out of the rubble comes an opportunity to rebuild.
</li><li>Then, one day, he was poring over data when he found an interesting correlation: people who said that they had experienced a major trauma in their childhood but had kept it a secret were significantly more likely to report health problems as adults than those who had spoken to others about the experience.
</li><li>Venting raw emotions and falling back on platitudes, he has found, does not lead to health benefits. But sustained and thoughtful writing does. It helps us move beyond our initial emotional reactions to something deeper.
</li><li>“If you can’t tap into a source of strength and power greater than yourself, you’re probably not gonna last.”
</li><li>Keeping meaning in mind also protects us against the damage stress can do. As Stanford’s Kelly McGonigal writes, summarizing a large body of research: “Stress increases the risk of health problems, except when people regularly give back to their communities. Stress increases the risk of dying, except when people have a sense of purpose. Stress increases the risk of depression, except when people see a benefit in their struggles.”
</li><li>The “work-and-spend” mentality that characterizes life today, as the author Gregg Easterbrook has written, alienates people from what really matters.
</li><li>As research by Teresa Amabile of Harvard Business School has found, “Of all the events that can deeply engage people in their jobs, the single most important is making progress in meaningful work.”
</li><li>According to the World Health Organization, the proportion of individuals over 60 in the world will double by the middle of this century—and, in the United States, one fifth of the population will be over sixty-five years old by 2050.
</li><li>“Nothing is so insufferable to man as to be completely at rest, without passions, without business, without diversion, without study,” wrote the French philosopher Blaise Pascal in his Pensées. “He then feels his nothingness, his forlornness, his insufficiency, his dependence, his weakness, his emptiness. There will immediately arise from the depth of his heart weariness, gloom, sadness, fretfulness, vexation, despair.”
</li><li>During the process of interviewing these individuals, he learned that the simple act of listening to another person could make that person feel valued, respected, and dignified. It kindled belonging. As he asked the people he interviewed his standard questions—how they would like to be remembered, who matters to them, what they are proud of—he saw their backs straighten and eyes light up. Isay realized that no one had ever asked them about their lives like that before; no one had ever taken a genuine interest in hearing their stories.
</li><li>“Being human,” Frankl wrote, “always points, and is directed, to something, or someone, other than oneself—be it a meaning to fulfill or another human being to encounter. The more one forgets himself—by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love—the more human he is.”

</h4><ul><li>The word degustation means what it says: not “consumption of” but “tasting,” “savoring” . . . You are in the country of the art of good food, and this degustation is very like what you do in an art gallery, unless your soul is lost.
</li><li>The word “companion” comes from the Old French, compaignon, literally “one who breaks bread with another.”
</li><li>That matters, the researchers say, because one of the strongest predictors of happiness is whether or not your attention is focused where you are in the present.
</li><li>A wonderful savoring strategy for the start of a trip is what Bryant calls “self-congratulation”: reminding yourself of how long you’ve waited for the moment to happen (you’re finally taking that solo vacation!) or why you deserve to be experiencing it (you spent a year saving up for a plane ticket). This “recalled anticipation,” Bryant said, is the joy of appreciating an experience that you had been looking forward to.
</li><li>Absorbing details and taking mental photographs of a moment is another way to savor it—a process Bryant calls “memory building.” While this mental snapshot captures a visual record—the green-and-white umbrellas of Les Deux Magots, the steeple of the Romanesque church—it’s not meant to be only a panoramic. The aim should be to build into your mental photograph the multisensory feeling of the moment as well: the air redolent with warm rain, the tinkling of porcelain cups being lifted and returned to saucers, the soft mercis and au revoirs. This way, when you mentally summon an experience, you’ll rekindle more than images.
</li><li>The Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh tells a story about being a child and taking half an hour, sometimes forty-five minutes, to finish a cookie that his mother bought him. “I would take a small bite and look up at the sky,” he wrote. “Then I would touch the dog with my feet and take another small bite. I just enjoyed being there, with the sky, the earth, the bamboo thickets, the cat, the dog, the flowers.”
</li><li>More than half of lunch meals are solitary. And more than 30 percent of Americans have dinner alone because they’re single or on a different schedule from their partner.
</li><li>As late as the beginning of the twentieth century, New Yorkers were debating legislative bills about whether women should be allowed to eat out without a male escort.
</li><li>Things weren’t much better in 1970. A New York magazine article that year began: “In this most liberal of cities, a woman has no legally guaranteed right to enter a restaurant.”
</li><li>Certainly, many scientists have described the role chance has played in their discoveries. The classic yellow Post-it note, for example, was born of attempts to create a strong adhesive that fell short. And its original yellow color was not part of some grand design: It was the only scrap paper that happened to be on hand.
</li><li>Years earlier, I had read a blurb about BookCrossing, a community of bibliophiles whose mission is to hide (“release” in BookCrosser parlance) books in “the wild” for others to find and enjoy.
</li><li>To anticipate is to court joy, to fall in love with a place the way it is in a book or a movie or an Eartha Kitt song. But to stay open to the unexpected is to embrace anticipation—to know that it serves its purpose before the journey begins and must then be set aside for reality, for whatever beautiful, strange, unpredictable thing awaits when we step off the ferry.
</li><li>In order to allow for creative self-renewal and growth, it’s really advisable to go outside the boundaries of what you do and expose yourself to alien worlds as much as possible.
</li><li>Science suggests that activities that lead us to feel uncertainty and discomfort “are associated with some of the most memorable and enjoyable experiences of people’s lives,” as the psychologists Robert Biswas-Diener and Todd B. Kashdan wrote in Psychology Today.
</li><li>Simply getting out of our comfort zones—trying a different route to work, introducing ourselves to a new neighbor, speaking up for something we believe in—is important, she found, because it can help us spot opportunities, discover a strength, and shape the trajectory of our life rather than regretting our inaction.
</li><li>I gave myself a specific assignment: Once a week, during routine errands, I would try something new or go someplace I hadn’t been in a long while.
</li><li>Research shows that not long after we get home from a vacation, we tend to return to our particular baseline level of happiness. To help prevent that from happening, I didn’t fully leave the cities I’d visited but instead made them filters through which I saw my own. I stopped into small bread and cheese shops, took my time with my coffee. Seemingly cheerless streets became opportunities for observing graffiti and strangers, for “coloring the external world with the warm hues of the imagination,” as Anthony Storr described creative living.
</li><li>The word “planet” is derived from an ancient Greek verb that means “to wander,”
</li><li>“We generally do not think about today’s ordinary moments as experiences that are worthy of being rediscovered in the future,” lead researcher Ting Zhang told the Association for Psychological Science. “However, our studies show that we are often wrong: What is ordinary now actually becomes more extraordinary in the future—and more extraordinary than we might expect.”

</h4><ul><li>If there is a state where the soul can find a resting-place secure enough to establish itself and concentrate its entire being there, with no need to remember the past or reach into the future, where time is nothing to it, where the present runs on indefinitely but this duration goes unnoticed, with no sign of the passing of time, and no other feeling of deprivation or enjoyment, pleasure or pain, desire or fear than the simple feeling of existence, a feeling that fills our soul entirely, as long as this state lasts, we can call ourselves happy, not with a poor, incomplete and relative happiness such as we find in the pleasures of life, but with a sufficient, complete and perfect happiness which leaves no emptiness to be filled in the soul.
</li><li>To be like God is to be without time or, rather, in time with no concern for time, free of the passions and troubles of the soul, experiencing something like calm in the face of things and oneself.
</li><li>“Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity?” He concludes that we witness something mysterious about ourselves and our origins in the contemplation of the sea, something vast, sublime and incomprehensible. He writes, “It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life.”
</li><li>Perhaps we might say that happiness recalled is more intense than happiness experienced because it is tinged with longing and melancholy.

Every night the liver grew back. An unpleasant situation, I’m sure you would agree. His transgression was to have given human beings the gift of fire and, with that, the capacity for craft, technological inventiveness and what we are fond of calling civilization.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Monday, May 1, 2023 1:16:03 PM
</h4><ul><li>When you talk with strangers, you make beautiful and surprising interruptions in the expected narrative of your daily life. You shift perspective. You form momentary, meaningful connections. You find questions whose answers you thought you knew. You reject the ideas that make us so suspicious of each other.
</li><li>This if nothing else: Talking to strangers is good for you. Talking to a stranger is, at its best, an exquisite interruption of what you were expecting to happen when you walked down the street or rode on a bus, shopped at the grocery store or wandered around a museum, whiled away some time on a park bench or waited in a long, slow line. When something unexpected happens it calls you to full attention, turns your awareness outward to the world. You are awake. When you interact with a stranger you’re not in your own head, you’re not on autopilot from here to there. You are present in the moment. And to be present is to feel alive.
</li><li>She held the gaze of a man on the other train for the long seconds their trains held still. As the doors closed, they waved to each other. The interaction was so emotionally moving for her that she remembers it to this day. For her, it was a moment of connection with a stranger that felt real and good. They didn’t need to know each other. Just being human was enough.
</li><li>We also have nothing to lose when we talk about our feelings and opinions and secrets and stories with strangers. We can be vulnerable and share openly with no consequences. If the stranger thinks poorly of us, is shocked, or disagrees, it doesn’t matter. A stranger can listen to your feelings without having to live with them.
</li><li>When I interview people, I quite intentionally engage in bodily mimicry. Interviews are a form of seduction, after all. I align my shoulders, I shift when they shift, I talk at the same speed they do. People open up. They tell me their secrets.
</li><li>Another easy way to start a conversation is by tossing out casual observations about the shared space you’re inhabiting. This is such a slam-dunk method that it sometimes even guides urban development.
</li><li>As a woman traveling alone without any connections, her survival strategy is this: Get one person to see you as fully human and then other people will too. Sometimes all that takes is a smile, but often it comes about when she asks for the help that she genuinely needs.
</li><li>Everything really interesting that happens between strangers begins when you bend invisible rules in positive ways.
</li><li>The only legit trespass is an occasional request to watch belongings while you get more food or use the restroom—although you can take the risk of commenting on a conversation your tablemates are having. As I said, I do this a lot and it’s usually a fun exchange.
</li><li>He was listening to music with headphones, sitting next to a woman also wearing headphones, who was moving a little to her music. He took off his headphones and held them out to her. She looked puzzled for a moment, then took hers off and traded with him. They listened to each other’s music for a few minutes and then traded back. Not a word passed between them.
</li><li>And documenting experiences is a special way of processing them for yourself.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Tuesday, May 2, 2023 9:32:06 AM
</h4><ul><li>Thus I, and millions of others, suffer from the uniquely modern malady that historian Darrin McMahon calls “the unhappiness of not being happy.”
</li><li>But that is the whole point of a European café: to linger excessively and utterly without guilt. No wonder most of the world’s great philosophers came from Europe. They hung out at cafés and let their minds wander until some radically new school of philosophy—existentialism, say—popped into their heads.
</li><li>The Cleopatra Sex Shop, the window display of which consists of a menagerie of large and alarmingly lifelike dildos, is only one block from the Pakistan Islamic Center.
</li><li>The World Database of Happiness is the secularist’s answer to the Vatican and Mecca and Jerusalem and Lhasa, all rolled into one.
</li><li>East Asian countries tend to emphasize harmony and fulfilling societal obligations rather than individual contentment; perhaps not coincidentally, these countries also report lower levels of happiness, what’s been called the East Asian Happiness Gap,
</li><li>While not technically a brooding philosopher, Freud did much to shape our views on happiness. He once said: “The intention that Man should be happy is not in the plan of Creation.”
</li><li>The American way is: If you’ve got it, flaunt it. The Swiss way is: If you’ve got it, hide it. One Swiss person told me, “You don’t dress or act like you’re rich. Of course, you might have a four-thousand-dollar espresso machine in your apartment.”
</li><li>The Swiss are as fond of rules as the Dutch are of marijuana and prostitution. In many parts of Switzerland, you can’t mow you lawn or shake your carpets on Sunday. You can’t hang laundry from your balcony on any day. You can’t flush your toilet after 10:00 p.m.
</li><li>The chances of encountering a snake, let alone dying from a snakebite, are extraordinarily remote. Yet modern humans continue to fear snakes even more, studies have found, than car accidents or homicide or any of the dozens of other more plausible ways we might meet our demise. The fear of snakes resides deep in our primitive brain.
</li><li>Switzerland has one of the world’s most liberal euthanasia laws. People travel from all over Europe to die here.
</li><li>Part of the problem, perhaps, is that being surrounded by happy people can be a real bummer sometimes. Franz Hohler, a well-known Swiss author, told me: “If I’m not happy, I think, ‘Shit, all of this beauty, all this functionality, why the hell am I not happy? What’s wrong with me?’
</li><li>One study found that, of all the factors that affect the crime rate for a given area, the one that made the biggest difference was not the number of police patrols or anything like that but, rather, how many people you know within a fifteen-minute walk of your house.
</li><li>“Maybe happiness is this: not feeling like you should be elsewhere, doing something else, being someone else. Maybe the current conditions in Switzerland . . . make it simply easier to ‘be’ and therefore ‘be happy.’
</li><li>Canadian happiness researcher John Helliwell believes that quality of government is the single most important variable that explains why some countries are happier than others.
</li><li>The Bhutanese were never colonized, never conquered, so their hospitality is served straight up, devoid of the gratuitous deference and outright ass-kissing so common in this part of the world.
</li><li>There are no atheists on Bhutan’s roads.
</li><li>“My way of thinking is completely different,” he says. “I have no such mountains to scale; basically, I find that living itself is a struggle, and if I’m satisfied, if I have just done that, lived well, in the evening I sigh and say, ‘It was okay.’
</li><li>The United States—with all of its resources—couldn’t save Somalia or Iraq, so why should I feel bad that I couldn’t save one bug?
</li><li>“The richer the society, the more difficult it becomes to do worthwhile things without immediate payoff.”
</li><li>“You see, everything is a dream. Nothing is real. You will realize that one day.”
</li><li>Compromise is a skill, and like all skills it atrophies from lack of use.
</li><li>I tell her that of the Bhutanese who study abroad, 90 percent return to Bhutan, forsaking western-style incomes for life here in Bhutan.
</li><li>Running after money has brought us happiness in the past, so we assume that it will do so in the future. That’s like saying to a starving man, “Here, eat this hamburger, you’ll feel better. That was good, yes? Now, here, eat another and another and another.”
</li><li>I would not have done anything differently. All of the moments in my life, everyone I have met, every trip I have taken, every success I have enjoyed, every blunder I have made, every loss I have endured has been just right. I’m not saying they were all good or that they happened for a reason—I don’t buy that brand of pap fatalism—but they have been right. They have been . . . okay. As far as revelations go, it’s pretty lame, I know. Okay is not bliss, or even happiness. Okay is not the basis for a new religion or self-help movement. Okay won’t get me on Oprah. But okay is a start, and for that I am grateful.
</li><li>Fifty years ago, Qataris eked out livings diving for pearls and herding sheep. Today, the only pearls they encounter are the million-dollar ones wrapped around their necks, and the only sheep they come across are the sheepskin seat covers on their new Mercedeses. Rarely before in history has one nation grown so wealthy so quickly.
</li><li>I read somewhere that Qatar is 98.09 percent desert. I wonder what the other 1.91 percent is. Mercedes, perhaps.
</li><li>As Rebecca Solnit observes in her lovely, lyrical book A Field Guide to Getting Lost, “Perhaps it’s true that you can’t go back in time, but you can return to the scene of a love, of a crime, of happiness, and of a fateful decision; the places are what remain, are what you can possess, are what is immortal.”
</li><li>Bertrand Russell, the British philosopher, concludes his book The Conquest of Happiness by describing a happy person thus: “Such a man feels himself a citizen of the universe, enjoying freely the spectacle that it offers and the joy that it affords, untroubled by the thoughts of death because he feels himself not really separated from those who will come after him. It is in such a profound instinctive union with the stream of life that the greatest joy is to be found.”
</li><li>“You have to understand, Eric. These are desert people. Life was tough back then. If you hiked for miles through the desert and you finally found someone with water, you wouldn’t say, ‘Excuse me, dear sir, but could you possibly spare some water?’ You would just blurt out, ‘Give me water, damn it, I’m dying of thirst!’ ” That’s why, explains Sami, the contemporary Qatari barks at the Starbucks barista when ordering a grande latte. It’s because of the desert.
</li><li>Social scientists estimate that about 70 percent of our happiness stems from our relationships, both quantity and quality, with friends, family, coworkers, and neighbors. During life’s difficult patches, camaraderie blunts our misery; during the good times, it boosts our happiness.
</li><li>So the greatest source of happiness is other people—and what does money do? It isolates us from other people. It enables us to build walls, literal and figurative, around ourselves. We move from a teeming college dorm to an apartment to a house and, if we’re really wealthy, to an estate. We think we’re moving up, but really we’re walling off ourselves.
</li><li>I can’t help but wonder: What if everyone had their own personal museum, actual buildings devoted to telling our stories?
</li><li>The truly surprising finding, though, is that even when the participants were forced to give up their money (to a good cause, they were told) the parts of the brain associated with altruism still fired.
</li><li>Islam, like other religions, maintains that if you want to be happy, put great effort into living a virtuous life and expect nothing, absolutely nothing. Divorce your actions from their results, and happiness will flow like oil.
</li><li>In 1978, psychologist Philip Brickman studied two groups of people. One group had just won the lottery and was now wealthy. Another group had been in accidents and was now paralyzed. Not surprisingly, shortly after these events, the lottery winners reported increased happiness, while the accident victims were less happy. But as Brickman tracked the groups, something wholly unexpected happened. The lottery winners soon returned to the same happiness levels as before they struck it rich. The paralyzed accident victims, meanwhile, rebounded to happiness levels only slightly lower than before their accident.
</li><li>Interestingly, there are two notable exceptions to the hedonic treadmill. Noise and big breasts.
</li><li>Neuroscientists have discovered that the parts of the brain that control wanting and the parts that control liking are separate; they operate independently of one another and involve different chemicals.
</li><li>So much of human misery can be explained by this crazy way we’re wired. We assume that our intense feelings of wanting something—a new car, winning the lottery—means that, once obtained, these things will make us happy. But that is a connection that, neurologically speaking, does not exist. We are disappointed but don’t learn from our disappointment because our software is flawed. It’s not faulty data but faulty programming that is holding us back, and that is much harder to rectify.
</li><li>In fact, researchers have found that people who are too busy are happier than those who are not busy enough.
</li><li>“Big mistake,” says the other man. “They should have kidnapped the maid. That way, the rich guy would have noticed that someone is missing.”
</li><li>Over the years, I have been spiritually promiscuous, dabbling in Hinduism, Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, and even occasionally Judaism.
</li><li>Theories abound as to why cold or temperate climes produce happier people than warm, tropical ones. My favorite theory is one I call the Get-Along-or-Die Theory. In warm places, this theory states, life is too easy; your next meal simply falls from a coconut tree. Cooperation with others is optional. In colder places, though, cooperation is mandatory. Everyone must work together to ensure a good harvest or a hearty haul of cod. Or everyone dies. Together.
</li><li>The entire population of Iceland is only three hundred thousand, roughly the same as that of Louisville, Kentucky, or your average bus stop in China.
</li><li>High inflation is shared pain; everyone feels the pinch of higher prices when they go to the grocery store or the gas station. Everyone suffers a little; no one suffers a lot. Unemployment is selective pain. A relatively few people suffer greatly, yet most of us don’t suffer at all.
</li><li>All languages share one trait, and it is not a happy one. As I discovered in Switzerland, every culture has many more words to describe negative emotional states than positive ones. This partly explains why I’ve found it so difficult to get people to talk to me about happiness. They literally don’t have the words to express it. It also makes me wonder: Are we hardwired for misery? Are we a species of whiners? Perhaps. Or maybe happiness is so sublime, so self-evident, that it doesn’t require many words to describe it.
</li><li>In his forty-odd years, Larus has earned a living not only as a chess player but also as a journalist, a construction-company executive, a theologian, and, now, a music producer. “I know,” he says, sensing my disbelief. “But that kind of résumé is completely normal in Iceland.”
</li><li>“It is never a waste of time to study how other people wasted time.”
</li><li>“Look, we’re living in an unprecedented age of mobility. You can determine how your life plays out by deciding where you live. You really can get away from yourself, or at least away from your past.
</li><li>She and Jared are refugees. Not political refugees, escaping a repressive regime, nor economic refugees, crossing a border in search of a better-paying job. They are hedonic refugees, moving to a new land, a new culture, because they are happier there. Usually, hedonic refugees have an epiphany, a moment of great clarity when they realize, beyond a doubt, that they were born in the wrong country.
</li><li>The psychologist Norman Bradburn, in his book The Structure of Psychological Well Being, describes how happiness and unhappiness are not opposites, as we often think. They are not two sides of the same coin. They are different coins.
</li><li>“You nurture your little melancholia, and it’s like a buzz that makes you feel alive. You snap yourself a little bit, and you feel this relief of how fragile life is and how tremendously fragile you are.”
</li><li>The measure of a society, he said, is how well it transforms pain and suffering into something worthwhile.
</li><li>That old saw about the glass being half full or half empty is dead wrong. What really matters is whether water is flowing into or out of the glass. In Moldova, the water is gushing out.
</li><li>In the late 1960s, a young Martin Seligman, now the pooh-bah of the positive-psychology movement, conducted experiments with dogs. He would place a dog in a cage and give it a (supposedly harmless) electric shock. The dog, though, could escape to another side of the cage and avoid the shock, the onset of which was signaled by a loud noise and a flashing light. Then Seligman put the dog in a no-win situation. No matter what he did, he couldn’t avoid getting shocked. Then, and this is the part that surprised Seligman, when he returned the same dog to a cage where he could easily avoid the shock (by jumping over a low fence), the dog did nothing. He just sat there and endured the shocks. He had been taught to believe that the situation was hopeless. He had learned to be helpless.
</li><li>today the former Soviet republics are, overall, the least happy places on the planet.
</li><li>It’s not that democracy makes people happy but rather that happy people are much more likely to establish a democracy.
</li><li>“Simply by counting the acts of kindness for one week, people become happier and more grateful,”
</li><li>Benjamin Franklin, America’s first self-help author, once wrote that happiness “is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen as by little advantages that occur every day.”
</li><li>The happiness research backs her up. People are not likely to be happy if they don’t have control over their lives—not in some abstract geopolitical sense, but in a real, everyday sense.
</li><li>When Luba is not looking, I slip an extra hundred-dollar bill into the English-Russian dictionary she has on a bookshelf and is always using to look up words. I put the bill next to “schaste,” the Russian word for happiness. It’s a melodramatic gesture, maybe even a selfish one—in the altruistic sense, that is.
</li><li>“Not my problem” is not a philosophy. It’s a mental illness. Right up there with pessimism. Other people’s problems are our problems. If your neighbor is laid off, you may feel as if you’ve dodged the bullet, but you haven’t. The bullet hit you as well. You just don’t feel the pain yet. Or as Ruut Veenhoven told me: “The quality of a society is more important than your place in that society.” In other words, better to be a small fish in a clean pond than a big fish in a polluted lake.
</li><li>Watts once said, “Only bad music has any meaning.” Meaning necessarily entails words, symbols. They point to something other than themselves. Good music doesn’t point anywhere. It just is. Likewise, only unhappiness has meaning. That’s why we feel compelled to talk about it and have so many words to draw upon. Happiness doesn’t require words.
</li><li>like a divorced couple who, for financial reasons, decide to continue living together.
</li><li>For if nothing you do matters, then life suddenly feels a lot less heavy. It’s just one big game.
</li><li>In the UK, we don’t want to bother anyone. When someone dies, we don’t call the relatives to offer our sympathies because we’re afraid we might disturb them. We don’t want to be too loud, too American.”
</li><li>As any economist will tell you, scarcity creates value. So when a Brit opens up, exposes their wounds, where it hurts, this is more valuable, more meaningful, than when an American does it. For the first time since I arrived in Britain, I appreciate the virtue of reticence.
</li><li>It’s something you have to experience. It’s not an intellectual thing.”
</li><li>Just put the happiness manifesto into action. Chat with someone who is down. Appreciate the moment. That’s it. Like this cappuccino. If it was bad, we’d be quick to complain. But if it was excellent, if it exceeded our expectations, would we write and compliment the café? No, we wouldn’t.”
</li><li>“Nearly all creators of utopia have resembled the man who has a toothache and therefore thinks happiness consists in not having a toothache.”
</li><li>There’s another reason, I think, why Calcutta’s poor are happier than America’s. If an Indian person is poor, it is because of fate, the gods, or some negative karma accumulated in a previous lifetime. In other words, they are not to blame. If an American is poor, it is seen as a personal failure, a flawed character.
</li><li>Once we see life as a game, no more consequential than a game of chess, then the world seems a lot lighter, a lot happier. Personal failure becomes “as small a cause for concern as playing the role of loser in a summer theater performance,” writes Huston Smith in his book The World’s Religions. If it’s all theater, it doesn’t matter which role you play, as long as you realize it’s only a role. Or, as Alan Watts said: “A genuine person is one who knows he is a big act and does it with complete zip.”
</li><li>And that, I realize, is the problem with hedonic floaters like Cynthia and with many of us Americans and our perpetual pursuit of happiness. We may be fairly happy now, but there’s always tomorrow and the prospect of a happier place, a happier life. So all options are left on the table. We never fully commit. That is, I think, a dangerous thing. We can’t love a place, or a person, if we always have one foot out the door.
</li><li>I am no philosopher, so here goes: Money matters, but less than we think and not in the way that we think. Family is important. So are friends. Envy is toxic. So is excessive thinking. Beaches are optional. Trust is not. Neither is gratitude.
</li><li>The perfect person would be insufferable to live with; likewise, we wouldn’t want to live in the perfect place, either. “A lifetime of happiness! No man could bear it: It would be hell on Earth,” wrote George Bernard Shaw, in his play Man and Superman.
</li><li>Happiness is not a noun or verb. It’s a conjunction.

</li><li>Throughout his career studying cities, the sociologist Richard Sennett has praised the idea of friction in life: those little inefficiencies that force you to interact with strangers—like asking a butcher for grilling tips, or asking for directions, or just ordering a pizza over the phone. With the march of technological progress, those interactions have become increasingly unnecessary. And that, I suspected, was eroding our social skills.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Wednesday, May 10, 2023 11:34:16 AM
</h4><ul><li>During a long retreat, I had what seemed to me the earth-shaking revelation that we cannot be in the present and run our story lines at the same time!
</li><li>“Only to the extent that we expose ourselves over and over to annihilation can that which is indestructible be found in us.”
</li><li>Things falling apart is a kind of testing and also a kind of healing. We think that the point is to pass the test or to overcome the problem, but the truth is that things don’t really get solved. They come together and they fall apart. Then they come together again and fall apart again. It’s just like that. The healing comes from letting there be room for all of this to happen: room for grief, for relief, for misery, for joy.
</li><li>The off-center, in-between state is an ideal situation, a situation in which we don’t get caught and we can open our hearts and minds beyond limit.
</li><li>Every day we could think about the aggression in the world, in New York, Los Angeles, Halifax, Taiwan, Beirut, Kuwait, Somalia, Iraq, everywhere. All over the world, everybody always strikes out at the enemy, and the pain escalates forever. Every day we could reflect on this and ask ourselves, “Am I going to add to the aggression in the world?” Every day, at the moment when things get edgy, we can just ask ourselves, “Am I going to practice peace, or am I going to war?”
</li><li>Things like disappointment and anxiety are messengers telling us that we’re about to go into unknown territory.
</li><li>After some time, Rinpoche added another refinement to the instruction. He began to ask us to label our thoughts “thinking.” We’d be sitting there with the out-breath, and before we knew what had happened, we were gone—planning, worrying, fantasizing—completely in another world, a world totally made of thoughts. At the point when we realized we’d gone off, we were instructed to say to ourselves “thinking” and, without making it a big deal, to simply return again to the out-breath.
</li><li>The most difficult times for many of us are the ones we give ourselves.
</li><li>Hope and fear come from feeling that we lack something; they come from a sense of poverty. We can’t simply relax with ourselves. We hold on to hope, and hope robs us of the present moment. We feel that someone else knows what’s going on, but that there’s something missing in us, and therefore something is lacking in our world.
</li><li>We are like children building a sand castle. We embellish it with beautiful shells, bits of driftwood, and pieces of colored glass. The castle is ours, off-limits to others. We’re willing to attack if others threaten to hurt it. Yet despite all our attachment, we know that the tide will inevitably come in and sweep the sand castle away. The trick is to enjoy it fully but without clinging, and when the time comes, let it dissolve back into the sea.
</li><li>We think that if we just meditated enough or jogged enough or ate perfect food, everything would be perfect. But from the point of view of someone who is awake, that’s death. Seeking security or perfection, rejoicing in feeling confirmed and whole, self-contained and comfortable, is some kind of death. It doesn’t have any fresh air. There’s no room for something to come in and interrupt all that. We are killing the moment by controlling our experience.
</li><li>To live is to be willing to die over and over again.
</li><li>Running away from the immediacy of our experience is like preferring death to life.
</li><li>If we find ourselves unworkable and give up on ourselves, then we’ll find others unworkable and give up on them. What we hate in ourselves, we’ll hate in others. To the degree that we have compassion for ourselves, we will also have compassion for others.
</li><li>We think that by protecting ourselves from suffering we are being kind to ourselves. The truth is, we only become more fearful, more hardened, and more alienated. We experience ourselves as being separate from the whole. This separateness becomes like a prison for us, a prison that restricts us to our personal hopes and fears and to caring only for the people nearest to us.
</li><li>One of the ways to practice patience is to do tonglen. When we want to make a sudden move, when we start to speed through life, when we feel we must have resolution, when someone yells at us and we feel insulted, we want to yell back or get even. We want to put out our poison. Instead, we can connect with basic human restlessness, basic human aggression, by practicing tonglen for all beings. Then we can send out a sense of space, which further slows things down. Sitting there, standing there, we can allow the space for the usual habitual thing not to happen. Our words and actions might be quite different because we allowed ourselves time to touch and taste and see the situation first.
</li><li>ONE OF THE best practices for everyday living when we don’t have much time for meditation is to notice our opinions.
</li><li>Opinions are opinions, nothing more or less. We can begin to notice them, and we can begin to label them as opinions, just as we label thoughts as thoughts. Just by this simple exercise we are introduced to the notion of egolessness. All ego really is, is our opinions, which we take to be solid, real, and the absolute truth about how things are. To have even a few seconds of doubt about the solidity and absolute truth of our own opinions, just to begin to see that we do have opinions, introduces us to the possibility of egolessness.
</li><li>One piece of advice that Don Juan gave to Carlos Casteneda was to do everything as if it were the only thing in the world that mattered, while all the time knowing that it doesn’t matter at all. That attitude leads to more appreciation and less burnout, because we do the job wholeheartedly and we care.
</li><li>“Approach what you find repulsive, help the ones you think you cannot help, and go to places that scare you.”
</li><li>Finally, couldn’t we just relax and lighten up? When we wake up in the morning, we can dedicate our day to learning how to do this. We can cultivate a sense of humor and practice giving ourselves a break. Every time we sit down to meditate, we can think of it as training to lighten up, to have a sense of humor, to relax. As one student said, “Lower your standards and relax as it is.”
</li><li>From the point of view of samaya, we could say that looking for alternatives is the only thing that keeps us from realizing that we’re already in a sacred world.
</li><li>We don’t experience the world fully unless we are willing to give everything away. Samaya means not holding anything back, not preparing our escape route, not looking for alternatives, not thinking that there is ample time to do things later.
</li><li>“Look at your mind. Be curious. Welcome groundlessness. Lighten up and relax. Offer chaos a cup of tea. Let go of ‘us and them.’ Don’t turn away. Everything you do and think affects everyone else on the planet. Let the pain of the world touch you and cause your compassion to blossom. And never give up on yourself.”

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Thursday, May 11, 2023 4:21:20 PM
</h4><ul><li>Since you seldom spoke, you were rarely wrong. You seldom spoke because you seldom went out. If you did go out, you listened and watched. Now, since you no longer speak, you will always be right. In truth, you do still speak: through those, like me, who bring you back to life and interrogate you. We hear your responses and admire their wisdom. If the facts turn out to contradict your counsel, we blame ourselves for having misinterpreted you. Yours are the truths, ours are the errors.
</li><li>Often all it took was for someone else to speak your own words back to you for you to like them.
</li><li>Your life was a hypothesis. Those who die old are made of the past. Thinking of them, one thinks of what they have done. Thinking of you, one thinks of what you could have become. You were, and you will remain, made up of possibilities.
</li><li>Your suicide was the most important thing you ever said, but you’ll never be able to enjoy the fruits of this labor.
</li><li>You used to believe that with age you would become less unhappy, because you then would have reasons to be sad. When you were still young, your suffering was inconsolable because you believed it to be unfounded.
</li><li>Only the living seem incoherent. Death closes the series of events that constitutes their lives. So we resign ourselves to finding a meaning for them.
</li><li>Your suicide makes the lives of those who outlive you more intense. Should they be threatened by boredom, or should the absurdity of their lives leap out at them from the curve of some cruel mirror, let them remember you, and the pain of existence will seem preferable to the disquietude of no longer being. What you no longer see, they look at. What you no longer hear, they listen to. The song you no longer sing, they burst into. The joy of simple things appears to them by the light of your sad memory. You are that black but intense glow, which, since the dying of your light, freshly illuminates the day that had become obscure to them.
</li><li>You died because you searched for happiness at the risk of finding the void. We shall have to wait for death before we can know what it is that you found.
</li><li>The way in which you quit it rewrote the story of your life in a negative form. Those who knew you reread each of your acts in the light of your last. Henceforth, the shadow of this tall black tree hides the forest that was your life. When you are spoken of, it begins with recounting your death, before going back to explain it. Isn’t it peculiar how this final gesture inverts your biography?
</li><li>You didn’t go to Peru; you didn’t like black boots; you never walked barefoot on a rosy, pebbled path. The sheer number of things you didn’t do is dizzying, because it throws light on the number of things we will ourselves be stripped of. For us, there will never be enough time. You chose to eschew more time. You renounced the future, the future that allows for survival, because we believe it is infinite. We want to be able to embrace all the earth, to taste all its fruits, to love all men. You rejected these illusions, which feed us with hope.
</li><li>You directed toward yourself a violence that you did not feel toward others. For them you reserved all your patience and tolerance.
</li><li>This was perhaps what you feared: to become inert in a body that still breathes, drinks, and feeds itself. To commit suicide in slow motion.
</li><li>You could not be happy on command, whether the order was given by you or by someone else. The moments of happiness you knew came unbidden. You could understand their sources, but you could not reproduce them.
</li><li>You knew that some of those close to you would feel guilty at not having anticipated your choice to die, and that they would deplore their inability to help you to want to live. But you thought them mistaken. No one other than yourself could have given you a greater taste for life than for death.
</li><li>But, all things considered, the lull of death won out over life’s painful commotion.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Friday, May 12, 2023 3:17:12 PM
</h4><ul><li>If we are to read The Antichrist, Nietzsche demands that we cultivate “an inclination, born of strength, for questions that no one has the courage for; the courage for the forbidden.” Terror has its uses. The questions that scare us the most are precisely the ones that deserve our full and immediate attention.
</li><li>“There exists in the world a single path along which no one can go except you: whither does it lead? Do not ask,” Nietzsche instructs, “go along it.”
</li><li>“It is not in our hands,” Nietzsche writes in The Twilight of the Idols, “to prevent our birth but we can correct this mistake … the man who does away with himself performs the most estimable of deeds.”
</li><li>“Marrying,” Schopenhauer tells us, “means to grasp blindfolded into a sack hoping to find an eel amongst an assembly of snakes.”
</li><li>“Sickness,” he explained, “detached me slowly [from society]: it spared me any break, any violent and offensive step … My sickness also gave me the right to abandon all my habits completely, it commanded me to forget.”
</li><li>“No one dies of fatal truths these days,” Nietzsche writes in Human, All Too Human, “there are too many antidotes.”
</li><li>In his Studies in Pessimism, he writes, “He who lives to see two or three generations is like a man who sits some time in the conjurer’s booth at a fair, and witnesses the performance twice or thrice in succession. The tricks were meant to be seen only once; and when they are no longer a novelty and cease to deceive, their effect is gone.”
</li><li>Of course you can choose anything you want, to raise children or get married, but don’t pretend to do it because these things have some sort of intrinsic value—they don’t. Do it solely because you chose them and are willing to own up to them. In the story of our lives, these choices are ours and ours alone, and this is what gives things, all things, value. Only when one realizes this is he or she prepared to face the eternal recurrence, the entire cycle, without the risk of being crushed. Only then is one able to say with Yeats, “[A]nd yet again,” and truly mean it.
</li><li>Over the last fifty years, folk psychology has concluded that severe anorexia is best explained as a response to a lack of personal control. It’s not about waist size or body fat or being sexy or fashionable. At root, it’s about self-possession.
</li><li>Nietzsche explains that “no price is too high for the privilege of owning yourself.”
</li><li>Imagine all the possibilities you have in life, multiply them by a power of ten and then another power of ten, and finally let yourself consider the many options you have, from a very young age, forbidden yourself. Now, whatever you are feeling—that is something like a weak, attenuated sense of freedom’s infinite possibility. The routine of adulthood usually numbs us to this sort of dread, but children do their best to remind us of its force.
</li><li>In September of that year (still fifteen, mind you), a frustrated Hesse longs for his revolver: “What I would not give for death!… I have lost everything now: home, parents, love, belief, hope, myself…” In the next year, he managed to get to Stuttgart, sell off some of the philosophy books that had underpinned his tremendous erudition, and used the money to buy another gun. But it remained, for the time being, unused.
</li><li>“You knew all along that your sanctioned world was only half the world and you tried to suppress the second half the way the priests and teachers do. You won’t succeed. No one succeeds in this once he has begun to think.”
</li><li>Most of modern life is geared toward achieving material success, but only after it is attained is its hollowness painfully apparent.
</li><li>It gave me just a hint: life does not change, but the attitude you bring to it might. And this is not a trivial adjustment. In fact, it may be the only meaningful adjustment that is possible. For a moment, I was happy, genuinely happy, happier than I’ve ever been, that I was still here. Right here, not somewhere else. The awful abyss, the existential terror, the feeling of inadequacy and privation—none of it mattered. It was, at worst, a figment of my imagination. It was as if I had finally come to—or realized that, after a long and frustrating investigation, I was simply asking the wrong sort of question. For just an instant, nothing frightened me and I longed for neither height nor depth.
</li><li>Hesse wrote in 1919, in a little-known essay titled “Zarathustra’s Return,” “If you … are in pain, if you are sick in body or soul, if you are afraid and have a foreboding of danger—why not, if only to amuse yourselves … try to put the question in a different way? Why not ask whether the source of your pain might be inside you yourselves?… Might it not be an amusing exercise for each one of you to examine what ails you and try to determine its source?”
</li><li>The point of life was not to “get a grip” but to loosen one’s hold just enough to get a fleeting sense of release.
</li><li>As it turns out, to “become who you are” is not about finding a “who” you have always been looking for. It is not about separating “you” off from everything else. And it is not about existing as you truly “are” for all time. The self does not lie passively in wait for us to discover it. Selfhood is made in the active, ongoing process, in the German verb werden, “to become.” The enduring nature of being human is to turn into something else, which should not be confused with going somewhere else. This may come as a great disappointment to one who goes in search of the self. What one is, essentially, is this active transformation, nothing more, nothing less. This is not a grand wisdom quest or hero’s journey, and it doesn’t require one to escape to the mountains. No mountain is high enough. Just a bit of cheese and any fast-moving river will suffice.
</li><li>The present, as such, is but a placeholder where the past and future meet, a fleeting moment where becoming takes place.
</li><li>And again, more dramatically, in Ecce Homo: “To become what one is, one must not have the faintest idea of what one is.”

But we choose and discard from an abundance of evidence what suits us at the moment.

</h4><ul><li>I do not think of suicide as the act, the death, the fall from a height or the trigger pulled. I see it as a long illness, an illness with origins in trauma and isolation, in deprivation of touch, in violence and neglect, in the loss of home and belonging. It is a disease of the body and the brain, if you make that distinction, but its etiology, its beginning, whether in early or later life, in the family or beyond, is social in nature.
</li><li>The disconnect felt, for want of a better way of putting it, dimensional—a disturbance in the cosmos. I have heard this sensation described as the glass wall. My friends and I occupied, it seemed, different times and places. We were sitting together, but we weren’t together. They lived in historical time, not in eternal dying; they had yesterdays, and a today and a tomorrow. The world from which they’d come, and to which they would return, was lost to me.

</h4><ul><li>“All the best things are like that, though, Lex, the most beautiful things. Part of the beauty comes from the fact that they’re short-lived.” He picked up a bouquet of deep-red roses, held it out to me. “These will never be as beautiful as they are at this moment, so we have to enjoy them now.”
</li><li>When Damian tells me about a movie he saw last weekend, I think, Ty will never see that movie. He’ll never play that new video game that Damian loves. He’ll never pass his sophomore year. And Damian will.
</li><li>“Perhaps you’re right,” she adds, “and what we feel as love is nothing more than a combination of certain chemicals in our bodies. But if we believe that love is this powerful force that binds us together, and if this belief brings us happiness and stability in this tumultuous world, then what’s the harm?”
</li><li>TIME PASSES. THAT’S THE RULE. No matter what happens, no matter how much it might feel like everything in your life has frozen around one particular moment, time marches on.

</li><li>I go through phases where I think everything’s going to be okay and the sky is blue and stuff and I can feel the sun and the air going in and out of my lungs and I think, life is good. But then every time, I also know deep down that the darkness is coming. And it’s going to keep coming. And when I’m in the darkness I’m going to screw up everything. And if you’re with me that’s when I’m going to screw you up, too.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Wednesday, June 28, 2023 12:56:53 AM
</h4><ul><li>I have little use for the past and rarely think about it;
</li><li>Until my thirtieth year, I lived in a state of almost continuous anxiety interspersed with periods of suicidal depression.
</li><li>I understood that the intense pressure of suffering that night must have forced my consciousness to withdraw from its identification with the unhappy and deeply fearful self, which is ultimately a fiction of the mind. This withdrawal must have been so complete that this false, suffering self immediately collapsed, just as if a plug had been pulled out of an inflatable toy. What was left then was my true nature as the ever-present I am: consciousness in its pure state prior to identification with form.
</li><li>So the single most vital step on your journey toward enlightenment is this: learn to disidentify from your mind. Every time you create a gap in the stream of mind, the light of your consciousness grows stronger.
</li><li>Your mind is an instrument, a tool. It is there to be used for a specific task, and when the task is completed, you lay it down.
</li><li>A strong unconscious emotional pattern may even manifest as an external event that appears to just happen to you. For example, I have observed that people who carry a lot of anger inside without being aware of it and without expressing it are more likely to be attacked, verbally or even physically, by other angry people, and often for no apparent reason. They have a strong emanation of anger that certain people pick up subliminally and that triggers their own latent anger.
</li><li>If you identify with a mental position, then if you are wrong, your mind-based sense of self is seriously threatened with annihilation. So you as the ego cannot afford to be wrong. To be wrong is to die.
</li><li>The secret of life is to “die before you die” — and find that there is no death.
</li><li>The reason why some people love to engage in dangerous activities, such as mountain climbing, car racing, and so on, although they may not be aware of it, is that it forces them into the Now — that intensely alive state that is free of time, free of problems, free of thinking, free of the burden of the personality.
</li><li>The great Zen master Rinzai, in order to take his students’ attention away from time, would often raise his finger and slowly ask: “What, at this moment, is lacking?” A powerful question that does not require an answer on the level of the mind. It is designed to take your attention deeply into the Now. A similar question in the Zen tradition is this: “If not now, when?”
</li><li>Meister Eckhart, the thirteenth-century spiritual teacher, summed it all up beautifully: “Time is what keeps the light from reaching us. There is no greater obstacle to God than time.”
</li><li>To alert you that you have allowed yourself to be taken over by psychological time, you can use a simple criterion. Ask yourself: Is there joy, ease, and lightness in what I am doing? If there isn’t, then time is covering up the present moment, and life is perceived as a burden or a struggle.
</li><li>To be free of time is to be free of the psychological need of past for your identity and future for your fulfillment.
</li><li>Once you realize that a certain kind of food makes you sick, would you carry on eating that food and keep asserting that it is okay to be sick?
</li><li>Die to the past every moment. You don’t need it. Only refer to it when it is absolutely relevant to the present.
</li><li>Every sound is born out of silence, dies back into silence, and during its life span is surrounded by silence. Silence enables the sound to be. It is an intrinsic but unmanifested part of every sound, every musical note, every song, every word. The Unmanifested is present in this world as silence. This is why it has been said that nothing in this world is so like God as silence.
</li><li>You then realize that death is an illusion, just as your identification with form was an illusion. The end of illusion — that’s all that death is. It is painful only as long as you cling to illusion.
</li><li>In other words, you are waiting for an event in time to save you. Is this not the core error that we have been talking about? Salvation is not elsewhere in place or time. It is here and now.
</li><li>Whenever anything negative happens to you, there is a deep lesson concealed within it, although you may not see it at the time. Even a brief illness or an accident can show you what is real and unreal in your life, what ultimately matters and what doesn’t.
</li><li>A Buddhist monk once told me: “All I have learned in the twenty years that I have been a monk I can sum up in one sentence: All that arises passes away. This I know.” What he meant, of course, was this: I have learned to offer no resistance to what is; I have learned to allow the present moment to be and to accept the impermanent nature of all things and conditions. Thus have I found peace.
</li><li>Whenever you notice that some form of negativity has arisen within you, look on it not as a failure, but as a helpful signal that is telling you: “Wake up. Get out of your mind. Be present.”
</li><li>Don’t let the mind use the pain to create a victim identity for yourself out of it. Feeling sorry for yourself and telling others your story will keep you stuck in suffering.
</li><li>As long as your mind with its conditioned patterns runs your life, as long as you are your mind, what choice do you have? None. You are not even there. The mind-identified state is severely dysfunctional. It is a form of insanity. Almost everyone is suffering from this illness in varying degrees. The moment you realize this, there can be no more resentment. How can you resent someone’s illness? The only appropriate response is compassion.
</li><li>If you cannot be present even in normal circumstances, such as when you are sitting alone in a room, walking in the woods, or listening to someone, then you certainly won’t be able to stay conscious when something “goes wrong” or you are faced with difficult people or situations, with loss or the threat of loss. You will be taken over by a reaction, which ultimately is always some form of fear, and pulled into deep unconsciousness.
</li><li>Is someone or something playing a game, a game with form? This is what the ancient seers of India asked themselves. They saw the world as lila, a kind of divine game that God is playing. The individual life forms are obviously not very important in this game. In the sea, most life forms don’t survive for more than a few minutes after being born. The human form turns to dust pretty quickly too, and when it is gone it is as if it had never been. Is that tragic or cruel? Only if you create a separate identity for each form, if you forget that its consciousness is God-essence expressing itself in form. But you don’t truly know that until you realize your own God-essence as pure consciousness.
</li><li>There is nothing personal in this: I am not teaching you. You are consciousness, and you are listening to yourself. There is an Eastern saying: “The teacher and the taught together create the teaching.”
</li><li>To listen to the silence, wherever you are, is an easy and direct way of becoming present. Even if there is noise, there is always some silence underneath and in between the sounds. Listening to the silence immediately creates stillness inside you.
</li></ul></div><div class="book"><h2>The Human Predicament (Benatar, David)
</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Friday, June 30, 2023 7:55:32 PM
</h4><ul><li>“The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all possible worlds; and the pessimist fears this is true.”
</li><li>One’s very existence is an extreme contingency. The chances that a particular human—oneself—would come into existence are remote. One’s ever having come into existence was dependent on a string of contingencies, including the existence of all one’s progenitors. Even if all of them, down to one’s great-grandparents, grandparents, and parents existed, the odds were still against one’s existing. One would not have existed if one’s parents had never met, or if they had met but never reproduced, or if they had reproduced but not precisely when they did. In the last case, a different sperm would have united with the ovum of the month to produce some other person.
</li><li>Someday, somebody might stand at one’s grave and wonder about the person represented by the name on the tombstone, and might reflect on the fact that everything that person—you or I—once cared about has come to nothing. It is far more likely, however, that nobody will spare one even that brief thought after all those who knew one have also died.
</li><li>Put another way, meaning, as a number of authors have suggested, is about “transcending limits.” A meaningful life is one that transcends one’s own limits and significantly impacts others or serves purposes beyond oneself.
</li><li>Even in the best-case scenario, it is hard to understand why God would create a being in order to prepare it for an afterlife, given that no afterlife would be needed or desired if the being had not been created in the first place. It is much like a parent creating a child for the purpose of that child’s having a satisfying retirement.
</li><li>However, to get some sense, consider that one study found that common dolphins and striped dolphins along the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula consume 27,500 tons of sardines, gadids, hake, and scads annually. That is over 75 tons of fish per day—by only two kinds of predators in one corner of the world’s oceans.
</li><li>In his view, there “is nothing in the world … that would so effectively help one to survive even the worst conditions as the knowledge that there is meaning in one’s life.”
</li><li>Life is meaningless, but it also has meaning—or, more accurately, meanings. There is no such thing as the meaning of life. Many different meanings are possible. One can transcend the self and make a positive mark on the lives of others in myriad ways. These include nurturing and teaching the young, caring for the sick, bringing relief to the suffering, improving society, creating great art or literature, and advancing knowledge.
</li><li>If suicide were morally problematic because it leads to an earlier death than would naturally have occurred, then saving lives, at least those not threatened by moral agents, is also morally problematic because it also subverts a person’s natural fate.
</li><li>In the United States, it has been estimated that one in two men and one in three women will develop cancer, and one in four men and one in five women will die from it.
</li><li>Arthur Schopenhauer makes a similar point when he asks us to “compare the respective feelings of two animals, one of which is engaged in eating the other.”35 The animal being eaten suffers and loses vastly more than the animal that is eating gains from this one meal.
</li><li>The implication of this is that death at the early stages of existence is less bad than it is later. It becomes worse as the psychological properties of a person develop, because these properties create psychological unity with the future self whom death deprives of various goods. Then, as one ages beyond one’s prime, the badness of death gradually diminishes, not because of a lack of psychological unity, but rather because death deprives one of less.
</li><li>We want long lives, but the longer we live, the more reason we have to fear that less life remains.63 This is yet another feature of the human predicament.
</li><li>Are we really to believe that decomposed, cremated, atomically incinerated, and ingested bodies are to be reconstituted and reanimated? The challenges in understanding the mechanics of this dwarf even other notable problems, such as the logistics of physically accommodating all the resurrected.
</li><li>We have plenty of evidence that our consciousness is a product of our brains. When we are given general anesthesia—administered to our physical bodies and affecting our physical brains—we lose consciousness. When our brains are deprived of oxygen or when we suffer a sufficiently powerful blow to the head, we similarly lose consciousness. It seems unlikely that consciousness, so vulnerable even during life, could then survive the death and decay of our brains.
</li><li>Childlessness might actually become more attractive if immortality became possible, as one would no longer need to “live on in one’s children.”
</li><li>Every birth is a death in waiting. When one hears of a birth, one must know that it is but a matter of time before that new human dies. Sandwiched between birth and death is a struggle for meaning and a desperate attempt to ward off life’s suffering. This is why a pessimistic view about the human condition leads to the anti-natalist conclusion that we ought not to procreate.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Saturday, July 1, 2023 8:52:43 PM
</h4><ul><li>German philosopher Julius Bahnsen
</li><li>A breach in the very unity of life, a biological paradox, an abomination, an absurdity, an exaggeration of disastrous nature. Life had overshot its target, blowing itself apart. A species had been armed too heavily—by spirit made almighty without, but equally a menace to its own well-being. Its weapon was like a sword without hilt or plate, a two-edged blade cleaving everything; but he who is to wield it must grasp the blade and turn one edge toward himself.
</li><li>“Most people learn to save themselves by artificially limiting the content of consciousness.”
</li><li>Consciousness has forced us into the paradoxical position of striving to be unself-conscious of what we are—hunks of spoiling flesh on disintegrating bones.
</li><li>Perhaps we might gain some perspective on our earthly term if we stopped thinking of ourselves as beings who enact a “life.” This word is loaded with connotations to which it has no right. Instead, we should substitute “existence” for “life” and forget about how well or badly we enact it. None of us “has a life” in the narrative-biographical way we think of these words. What we have are so many years of existence. It would not occur to us to say that any man or woman is in the “prime of existence.”
</li><li>Nature proceeds by blunders; that is its way. It is also ours.
</li><li>Choices for Living: Coping with the Fear of Dying (2002) by Thomas S. Langer.
</li><li>It seems that nature did not make us to feel too good for too long, which would be no good for the survival of the species, but only to feel good enough for long enough to keep us from complaining that we do not feel good all the time.
</li><li>As David Benatar has alleged in Better Never to Have Been, all procreators have red hands, morally and ethically speaking.
</li><li>Whenever someone asked U. G. how they could become like him, he always replied it would be impossible for them even to desire to become like him, because their motive for wanting to be like him was self-interested, and as long as they believed in a self that was interested in canceling itself, that self would want to keep itself alive and thus would not want to know ego-death.
</li><li>His way of thinking, for what it might be worth, parallels Zapffe’s in that it identifies ordinary consciousness as a “basic malfunction” that “is some kind of inflation or hyperactivity of the psychological survival-system”
</li><li>In the course of describing his transformation following his death as a result of anaphylactic shock in September 1995, Horwitz wrote: “There was no vestige of self-importance left. It felt like death had obliterated my ego, the attachments I had, my history, and who I had been. Death had been very democratic. It had eliminated innumerable distinctions. With one bold stroke my past had been erased. I had no identity in death. It didn’t stay erased—some would say that this was the real tragedy—but it was erased for a time. Gone was my personal history with all of its little vanities. The totality of myself was changed. The ‘me’ was much smaller and much more compact than it had been. All that there was, was right in front of me. I felt incredibly light. Personality was a vanity, an elaborate delusion, a ruse.”
</li><li>But as any good Buddhist (or even Pirandello’s Moscarda) could tell you, human beings have no more substance and value than anything else on earth. The incapacity to repose alongside both the mountains and the mold of this planet is the fountainhead of the torments we wreak on one another.
</li><li>(Ask the Nobel Prize–winning physicist Steven Weinberg, who notoriously said, “The more we know about the universe, the more meaningless it appears.”)
</li><li>Yes, egoism is good, and altruism is good, and fidelity to nature would be the best of all … if we could only get rid of consciousness. What makes mankind tragic is not that they are the victims of nature, it is that they are conscious of it. To be part of the animal kingdom under the conditions of this earth is very well—but as soon as you know of your slavery, the pain, the anger, the strife—the tragedy begins. We can’t return to nature, since we can’t change our place in it. Our refuge is in stupidity … There is no morality, no knowledge, and no hope; there is only the consciousness of ourselves which drives us about a world that … is always but a vain and floating appearance.
</li><li>We cannot linger in the stillness of nature’s vacuity. And so we have imagination to beguile us. A misbegotten hatchling of consciousness, a birth defect of our species, imagination is often revered as a sign of vigor in our make-up. But it is really just a psychic overcompensation for our impotence as beings. Denied nature’s exemption from creativity, we are indentured servants of the imaginary until the hour of our death, when the final harassments of imagination will beset us.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Monday, July 3, 2023 11:58:18 AM
</h4><ul><li>A major obstacle, he says, is when we misapply thought based on past experience to a completely new challenge that demands to be looked at totally anew.
</li><li>To have such understanding, many issues raised in this book, its author says, ‘demand a great deal of meditation, of inquiry … meditation in which the meditator is entirely absent, for the mind has emptied itself of the past’. He adds, ‘If you have read this book for a whole hour attentively, that is meditation.’ Then it is for the reader ‘to find out what happens’.
</li><li>It seems to me that all ideologies are utterly idiotic. What is important is not a philosophy of life but to observe what is actually taking place in our daily life, inwardly and outwardly. If you observe very closely what is taking place and examine it, you will see that it is based on an intellectual conception, and the intellect is not the whole field of existence; it is a fragment, and a fragment, however cleverly put together, however ancient and traditional, is still a small part of existence whereas we have to deal with the totality of life. And when we look at what is taking place in the world we begin to understand that there is no outer and inner process; there is only one unitary process, it is a whole, total movement, the inner movement expressing itself as the outer and the outer reacting again on the inner. To be able to look at this seems to me all that is needed, because if we know how to look, then the whole thing becomes very clear; and to look needs no philosophy, no teacher. Nobody need tell you how to look. You just look.
</li><li>If you try to study yourself according to another you will always remain a secondhand human being.
</li><li>To be free of all authority, of your own and that of another, is to die to everything of yesterday, so that your mind is always fresh, always young, innocent, full of vigour and passion. It is only in that state that one learns and observes.
</li><li>You can face a fact only in the present and if you never allow it to be present because you are always escaping from it, you can never face it, and because we have cultivated a whole network of escapes we are caught in the habit of escape.
</li><li>It is the struggle to repeat and perpetuate pleasure which turns it into pain. Watch it in yourself. The very demand for the repetition of pleasure brings about pain, because it is not the same as it was yesterday. You struggle to achieve the same delight, not only to your aesthetic sense but the same inward quality of the mind, and you are hurt and disappointed because it is denied to you.
</li><li>So thought is essential at certain levels but when thought projects itself psychologically as the future and the past, creating fear as well as pleasure, the mind is made dull and therefore inaction is inevitable.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Tuesday, July 11, 2023 11:31:26 AM
</h4><ul><li>I clearly remember granting her request solely because the voice in my head was so resistant to it.
</li><li>Just because the voice talks doesn’t mean I have to listen to it or let it affect the direction of my life. It has nothing to do with me—I can just relax regardless of what it’s saying. I was back to the basics: I am the one who notices the voice talking.
</li><li>I was teaching those classes because an amazing flow of events had put me there. I was driving home because an amazing flow of events had put me there. Neither of these destinations was decided by me. They were the result of my letting go of myself.
</li></ul></div><div class="book"><h2>Nietzsche (Stefan Zweig)
</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Thursday, July 13, 2023 3:16:23 PM
</h4><ul><li>All knowledge comes from suffering, ‘pain always searches to know the causes, whilst pleasure remains in a fixed position and does not look backwards’. We become ‘refined through pain’. Suffering, burrowing and scoring, breaks up the terrain of the soul and the tortuous labour of delving inwards, like the plough, turns the soil, enabling a new spiritual harvest. ‘Mighty pain is the last liberator of the spirit; she alone forces us to descend into our ultimate depths’, and he for whom it has been almost fatal has surely the right to proudly declaim these words: ‘I know life better, because I have so often been at the point of losing it.’
</li><li>‘How can you be thrown into this marvellous incertitude and multiplicity of existence without questioning it, without trembling with the desire and passion that is the result of such questioning!’
</li><li>‘It is disadvantageous for the thinker to be linked to any single person. When a man finds himself, it is preferable that he loses himself again from time to time and then rediscovers himself once more.’
</li><li>Christianity is identified as the culprit, for its belief in the hereafter, the key principle that casts its dark cloud over the modern world. This ‘malodorous Judaism, concocted of Rabbinic doctrines and superstition’ has crushed and stifled sensuality, the exhilaration of the world and for fifty generations has been the most lethal narcotic, causing moral paralysis in what was once a genuine life force.
</li><li>Lightness; that is Nietzsche’s last love, his highest measure of all things. What makes him light and gives him health is good: food, spirit, air, sun, landscape, music. What enables him to rise, to forgo the darkness and heaviness of life, the ugliness of truth, that alone is a source of grace.
</li></ul></div><div class="book"><h2>Shantaram (Gregory David Roberts)
</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Friday, July 21, 2023 3:58:45 PM
</h4><ul><li>Every day, when you’re on the run, is the whole of your life. Every free minute is a short story with a happy ending.
</li><li>I couldn’t know, then, that the little Bombay street guide had given me a name thousands of people, from Colaba to Kandahar, from Kinshasa to Berlin, would come to know me by. Fate needs accomplices, and the stones in destiny’s walls are mortared with small and heedless complicities such as those. I look back, now, and I know that the naming moment, which seemed so insignificant then, which seemed to demand no more than an arbitrary and superstitious yes or no, was in fact a pivotal moment in my life. The role I played under that name, and the character I became—Linbaba—was more real, and true to my nature, than anyone or anything that I ever was before it.
</li><li>The past reflects eternally between two mirrors—the bright mirror of words and deeds, and the dark one, full of things we didn’t do or say.
</li><li>The world and I are not on speaking terms, Karla said to me once in those early months. The world keeps trying to win me back, she said, but it doesn’t work. I guess I’m just not the forgiving type.
</li><li>You’re a good listener. That’s dangerous, because it’s so hard to resist. Being listened to—really listened to—is the second-best thing in the world.’
</li><li>In the face of all that is so wrong with the world, the very worst thing you can do is survive. And yet you must survive. It is this dilemma that makes us believe and cling to the lie that we have a soul, and that there is a God who cares about its fate.
</li><li>There’s a kind of luck that’s not much more than being in the right place at the right time, a kind of inspiration that’s not much more than doing the right thing in the right way, and both only really happen to you when you empty your heart of ambition, purpose, and plan; when you give yourself, completely, to the golden, fate-filled moment.
</li><li>It’s a fact of life on the run that you often love more people than you trust. For people in the safe world, of course, exactly the opposite is true.
</li><li>If fate doesn’t make you laugh, Karla said, in one of my first conversations with her, then you just don’t get the joke.
</li><li>‘The truth is that there are no good men, or bad men,’ he said. ‘It is the deeds that have goodness or badness in them. There are good deeds, and bad deeds. Men are just men—it is what they do, or refuse to do, that links them to good and evil. The truth is that an instant of real love, in the heart of anyone—the noblest man alive or the most wicked—has the whole purpose and process and meaning of life within the lotus-folds of its passion. The truth is that we are all, every one of us, every atom, every galaxy, and every particle of matter in the universe, moving toward God.’
</li><li>I think that when we grow up, and learn that happiness is rare, and passes quickly, we become disillusioned and hurt. And how much we suffer is a mark of how much we have been hurt by this realisation. Suffering, you see, is a kind of anger. We rage against the unfairness, the injustice of our sad and sorry lot.
</li><li>‘Abdul has a pet theory, Lin,’ said Khaled, the dour Palestinian. ‘He believes that certain men are cursed with qualities, such as great courage, that make them commit desperate acts. He calls it the hero curse, the thing that compels them to lead other men to bloodshed and chaos.
</li><li>‘The burden of happiness can only be relieved by the balm of suffering.’
</li><li>He was a man with the ambition to change the world forever. Nothing that he ever said or did—not even the quiet humility in his deep voice as he spoke to us then—was an accident, a chance, or anything but a calculated fragment of his plan.
</li><li>Then, to the general comment—I think that suffering is the way we test our love. Every act of suffering, no matter how small or agonisingly great, is a test of love in some way. Most of the time, suffering is also a test of our love for God.
</li><li>When we’re young, we think that suffering is something that’s done to us. When we get older—when the steel door slams shut, in one way or another—we know that real suffering is measured by what’s taken away from us.
</li><li>‘Like most things, and most people, it’s not as bad as it looks from the outside.’
</li><li>Nations neglect no men more shamefully than the heroes of their wars.’
</li><li>I love him because he has the task, where other men do not even have the dream, of changing the whole world.
</li><li>True to the general rule of slum life that the more money one made, the more poverty-stricken one had to look, Kumar’s appearance was more dishevelled and ragged than the meanest of his customers.
</li><li>Prisons are the temples where devils learn to prey. Every time we turn the key we twist the knife of fate, because every time we cage a man we close him in with hate.
</li><li>Cruelty is a kind of cowardice. Cruel laughter is the way cowards cry when they’re not alone, and causing pain is how they grieve.
</li><li>I’d learned the hard way that it’s wise to keep silent when prison authorities abuse their power: everything you do enrages them, and everything you say makes it worse. Despotism despises nothing so much as righteousness in its victims.
</li><li>I’ve known men like Khaled in prisons, on battlefields, and in the dens where smugglers, mercenaries, and other exiles meet. They all have certain characteristics in common. They’re tough, because there’s a kind of toughness that’s found in the worst sorrow. They’re honest, because the truth of what happened to them won’t let them lie. They’re angry, because they can’t forget the past or forgive it. And they’re lonely. Most of us pretend, with greater or lesser success, that the minute we live in is something we can share. But the past for every one of us is a desert island; and those like Khaled, who find themselves marooned there, are always alone.
</li><li>‘People say that money is the root of all evil,’ Khaled told me when we met in his apartment. His English was rich with accents of New York and Arabic and the Hindi that he spoke reasonably well. ‘But it’s not true. It’s the other way round. Money isn’t the root of all evil. Evil is the root of all money. There’s no such thing as clean money. All the money in the world is dirty, in some way, because there’s no clean way to make it. If you get paid in money, somebody, somewhere, is suffering for it.
</li><li>Someone told me once that if you make your heart into a weapon, you always end up using it on yourself.’
</li><li>Sooner or later, fate puts us together with all the people, one by one, who show us what we could, and shouldn’t, let ourselves become. Sooner or later we meet the drunkard, the waster, the betrayer, the ruthless mind, and the hate-filled heart. But fate loads the dice, of course, because we usually find ourselves loving or pitying almost all of those people. And it’s impossible to despise someone you honestly pity, and to shun someone you truly love.
</li><li>In all of these things, the sin in the crime is so great that a man must give up his soul for the profit he makes. And if a man gives his soul, if he becomes a soul-less man, it takes nothing less than a miracle for him to regain it.’
</li><li>You’ll be all right … Don’t worry … It’s a great adventure, your life, and it has only just begun …’
</li><li>‘But there is a chance, just a chance, that they would listen to you, and put an end to the torture of the other men?’ ‘There’s a chance. I don’t think it’s a big one.’ ‘But still there is a chance?’ he insisted. ‘Yes,’ I said flatly. ‘So it could be said that you are in a way responsible for the suffering of the other men?’
</li><li>The universe has a nature, for and of itself, something like human nature, if you like, and its nature is to combine, and to build, and to become more complex. It always does this. If the circumstances are right, bits of matter will always come together to make more complex arrangements.
</li><li>It is moving toward … something. It is moving toward some kind of ultimate complexity. We might not get there. An atom of hydrogen might not get there, or a leaf, or a man, or a planet might not get there, to that ultimate complexity. But we are all moving towards it—everything in the universe is moving towards it. And that final complexity, that thing we are all moving to, is what I choose to call God. If you don’t like that word, God, call it the Ultimate Complexity. Whatever you call it, the whole universe is moving toward it.’
</li><li>There is no objective and universally acceptable definition of good and evil. And until we have one, we will go on justifying our own actions, while condemning the actions of the others.’
</li><li>But the lies we tell ourselves are the ghosts that haunt the empty house of midnight.
</li><li>What I do know now, and didn’t know then is that, in the long run, motive matters more with good deeds than it does with bad. When all the guilt and shame for the bad we’ve done have run their course, it’s the good we did that can save us. But then, when salvation speaks, the secrets we kept, and the motives we concealed, creep from their shadows. They cling to us, those dark motives for our good deeds. Redemption’s climb is steepest if the good we did is soiled with secret shame.
</li><li>Red-lining a motorcycle means opening the throttle so hard, with every change of gears, that the needle on the rev-counter is twisted all the way round to the red zone of maximum revolutions. And that’s what we were doing, all of us, in our different ways, Karla and Didier and Abdullah and I: we were red-lining our lives. And Lisa. And Maurizio. Twisting the needle to the red zone.
</li><li>A Dutch mercenary in Kinshasa once told me that the only time he ever stopped hating himself was when the risk he faced became so great that he acted without thinking or feeling anything at all.
</li><li>You can never tell what people have inside them until you start taking it away, one hope at a time.
</li><li>It was black money, and black money runs through the fingers faster than legal, hard-earned money. If we can’t respect the way we earn it, money has no value. If we can’t use it to make life better for our families and loved ones, money has no purpose.
</li><li>I’d lost Prabaker and Abdullah, my closest friends, in the same week, and with them I’d lost the mark on the psychic map that says You Are Here. Personality and personal identity are in some ways like co-ordinates on the street map drawn by our intersecting relationships. We know who we are and we define what we are by references to the people we love and our reasons for loving them.
</li><li>One of the worst of my many failings, in those exile years, was my blindness to the good in people: I never knew how much goodness there was in a man or a woman until I owed them more than I could repay.
</li><li>It’s … have you ever had the feeling—about anything at all—that your whole life is kind of a prelude, or something—like everything you’ve ever done has been leading you up to this one point, and you knew, somehow, that one day you’d get there?
</li><li>and I knew that my life, there and then, was no more than a handful of sand squeezed into my clenched fist.
</li><li>There’s a theory that snoring at night in sleep is a subconscious defence reflex—a warning sound that frightened potential predators away from the mouth of the cave when our lower-Palaeolithic ancestors huddled in vulnerable sleep.
</li><li>To continue, every atom in the universe has the characteristic of life. The more complex way that atoms get put together, the more complex is the expression of the characteristic of life. A rock is a very simple arrangement of atoms, so the life in a rock is so simple that we cannot see it. A cat is a very complex arrangement of atoms, so the life in a cat is very obvious. But life is there, in everything, even in a rock, and even when we cannot see it.’
</li><li>Jealousy, like the flawed love that bears it, has no respect for time or space or wisely reasoned argument. Jealousy can raise the dead with a single, spiteful taunt, or hate a perfect stranger for nothing more than the sound of his name.
</li><li>I didn’t know then, as I do now, that love’s a one-way street. Love, like respect, isn’t something you get; it’s something you give.
</li><li>Every door is a portal leading through time as well as space. The same doorway that leads us into and out of a room also leads us into the past of the room and its ceaselessly unfolding future.
</li><li>The money didn’t mean anything to him, don’t you see? You can’t reason with a man who has no sense of money and its … its value.
</li><li>She’d confused honour with virtue. Virtue is concerned with what we do, and honour is concerned with how we do it. You can fight a war in an honourable way—the Geneva Convention exists for that very reason—and you can enforce the peace without any honour at all.
</li><li>I was surrounded by friends, in a vast, crowded restaurant, but I was lonelier than a mujaheddin sentry on the night before battle.
</li><li>Silences can wound as surely as the twisting lash, the poet Sadiq Khan once wrote. But sometimes, being silent is the only way to tell the truth. I watched Modena turn and limp away, and I knew that the wordless minute we’d shared, with his hand on my chest and his breached and weeping eyes close to mine, would always be more precious and even more honest for both of us, no matter how errable or misunderstood, than the cold, unloving truth of his world alone, or of mine.
</li><li>The cloak of the past is cut from patches of feeling, and sewn with rebus threads. Most of the time, the best we can do is wrap it around ourselves for comfort or drag it behind us as we struggle to go on. But everything has its cause and its meaning. Every life, every love, every action and feeling and thought has its reason and significance: its beginning, and the part it plays in the end. Sometimes, we do see. Sometimes, we see the past so clearly, and read the legend of its parts with such acuity, that every stitch of time reveals its purpose, and a kind of message is enfolded in it. Nothing in any life, no matter how well or poorly lived, is wiser than failure or clearer than sorrow. And in the tiny, precious wisdom that they give to us, even those dread and hated enemies, suffering and failure, have their reason and their right to be.
</li><li>They couldn’t understand that every time I entered the slum I felt the urge to let go and surrender to a simpler, poorer life that was yet richer in respect, and love, and a vicinal connectedness to the surrounding sea of human hearts. They couldn’t understand what I meant when I talked about the purity of the slum: they’d been there, and seen the wretchedness and filth for themselves. They saw no purity. But they hadn’t lived in those miraculous acres, and they hadn’t learned that to survive in such a writhe of hope and sorrow the people had to be scrupulously and heartbreakingly honest. That was the source of their purity: above all things, they were true to themselves.
</li><li>‘Luck is what happens to you when fate gets tired of waiting,’
</li><li>I remembered one of Khaderbhai’s favourite phrases. Every human heartbeat, he’d said many times, is a universe of possibilities. And it seemed to me that I finally understood exactly what he’d meant. He’d been trying to tell me that every human will has the power to transform its fate. I’d always thought that fate was something unchangeable: fixed for every one of us at birth, and as constant as the circuit of the stars. But I suddenly realised that life is stranger and more beautiful than that. The truth is that, no matter what kind of game you find yourself in, no matter how good or bad the luck, you can change your life completely with a single thought or a single act of love.
</li><li>For this is what we do. Put one foot forward and then the other. Lift our eyes to the snarl and smile of the world once more. Think. Act. Feel. Add our little consequence to the tides of good and evil that flood and drain the world. Drag our shadowed crosses into the hope of another night. Push our brave hearts into the promise of a new day. With love: the passionate search for a truth other than our own. With longing: the pure, ineffable yearning to be saved. For so long as fate keeps waiting, we live on. God help us. God forgive us. We live on.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Friday, August 4, 2023 1:52:50 AM
</h4><ul><li>“God is Love; His plan for creation can be rooted only in love. Does not that simple thought, rather than erudite reasonings, offer solace to the human heart? Every saint who has penetrated to the core of Reality has testified that a divine universal plan exists and that it is beautiful and full of joy.”
</li><li>“Why be elated by material profit?” Father replied. “The one who pursues a goal of even-mindedness is neither jubilant with gain nor depressed by loss. He knows that man arrives penniless in this world, and departs without a single rupee.”
</li><li>Our family moved to Lahore in the Punjab.
</li><li>“I myself consider Kriya the most effective device of salvation through self-effort ever to be evolved in man’s search for the Infinite.”
</li><li>“God is simple. Everything else is complex. Do not seek absolute values in the relative world of nature.”
</li><li>Self-scrutiny, relentless observance of one’s thoughts, is a stark and shattering experience. It pulverises the stoutest ego.
</li><li>“A frog is also at home in the water!” Abu Said pointed out in gentle scorn. “The crow and the vulture easily fly in the air; the Devil is simultaneously present in the East and in the West! A true man is he who dwells in righteousness among his fellowmen, who may buy and sell, yet is never for a single instant forgetful of God!”
</li><li>On another occasion the great Persian teacher gave his views on the religious life thus: “To lay aside what you have in your head (selfish desires and ambitions); to bestow freely what you have in your hand; and never to flinch from the blows of adversity!”
</li><li>Grateful friends are only the Lord in disguise, looking after His own.
</li><li>“I have left a few paltry rupees, a few petty pleasures, for a cosmic empire of endless bliss. How then have I denied myself anything? I know the joy of sharing the treasure. Is that a sacrifice? The shortsighted worldly folk are verily the real renunciants! They relinquish an unparalleled divine possession for a poor handful of earthly toys!”
</li><li>Love, hate, joy, fear, pleasure, pain, excitability, stupor, and countless other appropriate responses to stimuli are as universal in plants as in animals.”
</li><li>“Bose instruments have demonstrated that metals, such as the steel used in scissors and machinery, are subject to fatigue, and regain efficiency by periodic rest. The life pulse in metals is seriously harmed or even extinguished through the application of electric currents or heavy pressure.”
</li><li>The Vedas were a revelation by sound, “directly heard” (shruti ) by the rishis. It is essentially a literature of chant and recitation. For millenniums, therefore, the 100,000 couplets of the Vedas were not written down, but were orally transmitted by Brahmin priests. Paper and stone alike are subject to the obliterating effects of time. The Vedas have persisted down the ages because the rishis understood the superiority of mind over matter as the proper means of transmittal.
</li><li>So deep was his sense of identity with Sri Ramakrishna that Master Mahasaya no longer considered his thoughts to be his own.
</li><li>As all things can be reflected in water, so the whole universe is mirrored in the lake of the Cosmic Mind.
</li><li>Because the very nature of God is Bliss, the man in attunement with Him experiences a native boundless joy.
</li><li>Do not imagine that rice sustains you nor that money or men support you. Could they aid if the Lord withdraws your life breath? They are His instruments merely. Is it by any skill of yours that food digests in your stomach? Use the sword of your discrimination, Mukunda! Cut through the chains of agency and perceive the Single Cause!”
</li><li>“Ordinary love is selfish, darkly rooted in desires and satisfactions. Divine love is without condition, without boundary, without change. The flux of the human heart is gone forever at the transfixing touch of pure love.”
</li><li>“Money first; God can come later! Who knows? Life may be too long.” “God first; money is His slave! Who can tell? Life may be too short.”
</li><li>Hindu scriptures teach that the incarnating ego requires a million years to obtain liberation from maya . This natural period is greatly shortened through Kriya Yoga
</li><li>“Another early memory is my wish for an ugly dog belonging to a neighbour. I kept my household in turmoil for weeks to get that dog. My ears were deaf to offers of pets with more prepossessing appearance. Moral: Attachment is blinding; it lends an imaginary halo of attractiveness to the object of desire.
</li><li>A master—one who has realized himself as the omnipresent soul, not the body or the ego—perceives in all men a striking similarity.
</li><li>A Self-realized master has already left behind the steppingstone of meditation. “The flower falls when the fruit appears.”
</li><li>Thought is a force, even as electricity or gravitation. The human mind is a spark of the almighty consciousness of God. I could show you that whatever your powerful mind believes very intensely would instantly come to pass.’
</li><li>A saying from the Hindu scriptures is: “In shallow men the fish of little thoughts cause much commotion. In oceanic minds the whales of inspiration make hardly a ruffle.”
</li><li>“The body is a treacherous friend. Give it its due; no more. Pain and pleasure are transitory; endure all dualities with calmness, trying at the same time to remove yourself beyond their power.
</li><li>“So long as you breathe the free air of earth, you are under obligation to render grateful service. Only he who has fully mastered the breathless state 16 is freed from cosmic imperatives.”
</li><li>“Some people try to be tall by cutting off the heads of others!”
</li><li>“Are you able to have a little room where you can close the door and be alone?” “Yes.” I reflected that this saint descended from the general to the particular with disconcerting speed. “That is your cave.” The yogi bestowed on me a gaze of illumination which I have never forgotten. “That is your sacred mountain. That is where you will find the kingdom of God.”
</li><li>“The muscles relax during sleep; but the heart, lungs, and circulatory system are constantly at work; they get no rest. In superconsciousness, all internal organs remain in a state of suspended animation, electrified by the cosmic energy. By such means I have found it unnecessary to sleep for years.”
</li><li>Do not fix your spiritual ideal on small mountains, but hitch it to the star of unqualified divine attainment. If you work hard, you will get there.”
</li><li>I do not expect anything from others, so their actions cannot be in opposition to wishes of mine.
</li><li>“The Lord has created all men from the illimitable joy of His being. Though they are painfully cramped by the body, God nevertheless expects that men made in His image shall ultimately rise above all sense identifications and reunite with Him.”
</li><li>The breath and the restless mind, I saw, are like storms that lash the ocean of light into waves of material forms—earth, sky, human beings, animals, birds, trees. No perception of the Infinite as One Light can be had except by calming those storms.
</li><li>Spiritual advancement is not to be measured by one’s displays of outward powers, but solely by the depth of his bliss in meditation.
</li><li>Thoughts are no more than very subtle vibrations moving in the ether. Just as a correctly tuned radio picks up a desired musical number out of thousands of other programmes from every direction, so Sri Yukteswar had been sensitively receptive to a certain pertinent thought (that of the half-witted man who was hankering for a cauliflower), out of the countless thoughts of broadcasting human minds in the world.
</li><li>Any erroneous thought of man is a result of an imperfection, large or small, in his discernment. The goal of yoga science is to calm the mind, that without distortion it may hear the infallible counsel of the Inner Voice.
</li><li>“The deeper the Self-realization of a man, the more he influences the whole universe by his subtle spiritual vibrations, and the less he himself is affected by the phenomenal flux.” These words of Master’s often returned inspiringly to my mind.
</li><li>The life span for a whole universe, according to the ancient seers, is 314,159,000,000,000 solar years, or “One Age of Brahma.”
</li><li>In later years, after I had toured many countries, I understood why Kashmir is often called the world’s most scenic spot. It possesses some of the charms of the Swiss Alps, and of Loch Lomond in Scotland, and of the exquisite English lakes.
</li><li>“When there is duality because of ignorance, one sees all things as distinct from the Self,” Shankara, the great monist has written. “When everything is known as the Self, not even an atom is seen as other than the Self.... As soon as knowledge of the Reality has sprung up, there can be no fruits of past actions to be experienced, owing to the unreality of the body, just as there can be no dream after waking.”
</li><li>A true yogi may remain dutifully in the world; there he is like butter on water, and not like the unchurned, easily diluted milk of undisciplined humanity. Fulfilling one’s earthly responsibilities need not separate man from God, provided he maintains mental uninvolvement with egotistical desires and plays his part in life as a willing instrument of the Divine.
</li><li>Kriya Yoga is twice referred to by Lord Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita. One stanza reads: “Offering the inhaling breath into the exhaling breath and offering the exhaling breath into the inhaling breath, the yogi neutralises both breaths; thus he releases prana from the heart and brings life force under his control.”
</li><li>Another Gita stanza states: “That meditation-expert (muni ) becomes eternally free who, seeking the Supreme Goal, is able to withdraw from external phenomena by fixing his gaze within the mid-spot of the eyebrows and by neutralising the even currents of prana and apana [that flow] within the nostrils and lungs; and to control his sensory mind and intellect; and to banish desire, fear, and anger.”
</li><li>The sleeping man becomes a yogi; each night he unconsciously performs the yogic rite of releasing himself from bodily identification, and of merging the life force with healing currents in the main brain region and in the six subdynamos of his spinal centres. Unknowingly, the sleeper is thus recharged by the cosmic energy that sustains all life.
</li><li>“The stream of knowledge,” Sir James Jeans writes in The Mysterious Universe, 8 “is heading toward a non-mechanical reality; the universe begins to look more like a great thought than like a great machine.”
</li><li>The tragedy of death is unreal; those who shudder at it are like an ignorant actor who dies of fright on the stage when nothing more has been fired at him than a blank cartridge.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Saturday, August 5, 2023 2:00:50 AM
</h4><ul><li>Candrakīrti tells the story of a man who is afraid that a poisonous snake has taken up residence in one of the walls of his house. In order to alleviate his fear, the man searches the house for an elephant, and satisfies himself that there is none there. He then rests at ease.
</li><li>Just so, according to the Gītā, you, the ātman, put on a new mind and body in each life, but are never identical to any mind or body; instead, you are the bearer of that mind and body, which are just as much objects to your subjectivity as any external phenomenon. [2.22]4 Your mind and body are instruments by means of which you know and act on the world, and they are therefore distinct from that self that makes use of those instruments.
</li><li>Indian philosopher Śāntideva argues in How to Lead an Awakened Life (Bodhicāryāvatāra)
</li><li>So, in one obvious sense, I am not identical to the person called by my name yesterday. We are alike, causally related, but numerically distinct. In another sense, though, we are the same person. We share a name, many properties, a causal history, and a social role; and that, while not involving a self, is enough.
</li><li>So, the world we inhabit—just like the worlds of dogs, birds, and bees—is not a world we encounter, but a world in which we participate and which we co-construct.
</li><li>To my mind, that natural attitude of taking ourselves to be selves is a symptom of a profound instinct for self-alienation, and is the deepest form of what Buddhist philosophers call primal confusion, the root of suffering.
</li><li>The key to this more realistic self-understanding lies in the distinction between a self as we have characterized it and a person.
</li><li>The term derives from the Latin persona, literally denoting a mask of the kind worn in the theatre, and metonymically denoting a role.
</li><li>Uddyotakara and Descartes each argue that thought is a property or an action of a thinking thing, just as redness is a property of my apple. Since properties can only inhere in substances, and actions can only be undertaken by substantial agents, they each conclude that thinkers are substantial agents. And to be such a substantial agent is to be a self—that special kind of substance in which thought inheres, or that performs acts of thought.
</li><li>There are times—perhaps more than we realize—when we don’t represent ourselves as selves at all, when we spontaneously engage with the world in ways that implicate no sense of self. And indeed, these may be the most pleasant and rewarding moments of our lives.
</li><li>To take ourselves to be selves, as we saw in chapter 1, is to take ourselves to be subjects with a very different mode of existence than that we assign to our objects. It is to regard ourselves as standing against the world rather than as being embedded in it.
</li><li>When we are immersed in action, our conscious perspective includes that of the equipment through which we engage, just as a blind person experiences her point of contact with the world at the end of a cane. Keeping this in mind helps to reinforce the idea that the imagination of the self is context-specific, and always a construction, not a discovery.
</li><li>Well, we already know that on the metaphysical side, the alternative to understanding our mode of existence as that of selves is to understand ourselves as persons—as beings who come into existence in open causal interaction with the rest of the world, and whose identity is constituted by the collectively composed narrative in which we are dramatis personae. To see oneself that way is to locate oneself in a decentered universe, with no special moral point of origin, and in which one’s own location is no more special than that of anyone else. That is to see oneself as a character in a play with no special protagonists, a play performed and written on the fly by a vast improv collective. This universe, unlike the one that motivates egoism, gives one no reason for special self-regard, or to distinguish between the moral standing of others in virtue of their relationships to oneself.
</li><li>They are summarized in Buddhist theory under the four divine states (brahmavihāras) as friendliness, care, sympathetic joy, and impartiality.
</li><li>When we deliberate about what to do, or when we assign blame or praise to ourselves or others, we often instinctively do so on the assumption that our—or their—actions are not caused by previous events. Instead, we pre-reflectively take our actions, as well as those of others, to be the result of what gets called “agent causation,” a spontaneous act of the will unconstrained by deterministic causes. So, if I become annoyed because you push me from behind, you might mollify me by pointing out that you did not voluntarily push me, but were yourself pushed into me by the person behind you. Knowing that your motion was caused and not a free action reduces the likelihood that I will blame you for it.
</li><li>Augustine solved this theological conundrum by introducing the idea of a free will. Note that this required him to introduce two new ideas: that of a will, and that of its exemption from causation. The will was introduced as a faculty: a tool at our disposal, the general ability to initiate action. The idea that it is free is the idea that when we deploy this will, there is no antecedent cause for our volition. We simply initiate the action on our own, intervening in the causal order from the outside, so to speak.
</li><li>But there is a dark side to narrative as well. For one thing, as we saw in chapter 3, we are not the sole authors of the stories in which we participate, and some of these tales may be deeply destructive.
</li><li>Śāntideva makes this point eloquently in How to Lead an Awakened Life. He argues that we can only cultivate attitudes of friendliness and care for others when we are able to project ourselves imaginatively into their situations, when we can regard others as our mothers, when we recognize our thoroughgoing interdependence with them, and when we abandon the fantasy that we and they are the agents of independent, free action. When we do so, he argues, we come to see that suffering is bad not because it is ours, but because it is bad, per se, no matter whose it is, and that happiness is good not just when it is ours, but wherever it arises.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Thursday, August 10, 2023 12:57:08 AM
</h4><ul><li>Living is a form of not being sure, not knowing what next or how. The moment you know how, you begin to die a little. The artist never entirely knows. We guess. We may be wrong, but we take leap after leap in the dark.
</li><li>But it’s not impermanence per se, or even knowing we’re going to die, that is the cause of our suffering, the Buddha taught. Rather, it’s our resistance to the fundamental uncertainty of our situation. Our discomfort arises from all of our efforts to put ground under
</li><li>If we can get in touch with the sensation as sensation and open ourselves to it without labeling it good or bad, then even when we feel the urge to draw back, we can stay present and move forward into the feeling.
</li><li>an emotion like anger that’s an automatic response lasts just ninety seconds from the moment it’s triggered until it runs its course. One and a half minutes, that’s all. When it lasts any longer, which it usually does, it’s because we’ve chosen to rekindle it.
</li><li>We have a choice. We can spend our whole life suffering because we can’t relax with how things really are, or we can relax and embrace the open-endedness of the human situation, which is fresh, unfixated, unbiased.
</li><li>attention, it’s the projector. It isn’t the current story line that’s the root of our pain; it’s our propensity to be bothered in the first place.
</li><li>isn’t the content of our movie that needs our attention, it’s
</li><li>It isn’t the content of our movie that needs our attention, it’s the projector. It isn’t the current story line that’s the root of our pain; it’s our propensity to be bothered in the first place.
</li><li>The basic instruction is to let the thoughts go—or to label them “thinking”—and stay with the immediacy of your experience.
</li><li>Buddhism holds that the true nature of the mind is as vast as the sky and that thoughts and emotions are like clouds that, from our vantage point, obscure it.
</li><li>Be fully present. Feel your heart. And engage the next moment without an agenda.
</li><li>Each time we don’t refrain but speak or act out instead, we’re strengthening old habits, strengthening the kleshas, and strengthening the fixed sense of self.
</li><li>To bring our attention back to the breath, we use a technique called labeling. Whenever we notice that we’re distracted, we make a mental note, “thinking,” then gently return our attention to the breath.
</li><li>I like to imagine that thoughts are bubbles and that labeling them is like touching a bubble with a feather.
</li><li>Shantideva says that reputation is about as flimsy as a child’s sand castle. We build it up, decorate it beautifully, and take great pride in it, but at the turn of the tide it all gets swept away.
</li><li>After he was diagnosed with cancer, the visionary genius Steve Jobs had this to say about freedom from the eight worldly concerns: Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.
</li><li>Awakening is not a process of building ourselves up but a process of letting go.
</li><li>The commitment to take care of one another is often described as a vow to invite all sentient beings to be our guest.
</li><li>So we make a commitment that for the rest of our lives, we’ll train in freeing ourselves from the tyranny of our own reactivity, our own survival mechanisms, our own propensities to be hooked.
</li><li>And now as long as space endures, As long as there are beings to be found, May I continue likewise to remain To drive away the sorrows of the world.
</li><li>There is a traditional Buddhist tale that illustrates this point. A sea captain known as Captain Courage was piloting a ship carrying five hundred men when a pirate boarded the boat and threatened to kill them all. The captain realized that if the pirate carried out his plan, he would not only kill all the passengers but also sow the seeds of his own intense suffering. So, out of compassion for the pirate as well as to save the five hundred men, the captain killed the pirate.
</li><li>Many years ago, one of the monks at Gampo Abbey introduced me to the practice of saying to myself when I wake up, “I wonder what will happen today.” That’s the spirit of taking a leap.
</li><li>It’s the troublemakers in your life who cause you to see that you’ve shut down, that you’ve armored yourself, that you’ve hidden your head in the sand. If you didn’t get angry at them, if you didn’t get fed up with them, you would never be able to cultivate patience.
</li><li>The way we label things is the way they will appear to us. When we label a piece of the earth China or Brazil or the United States, it becomes an entity that carries strong emotional baggage. When we label something good, we see it as good. When we label something bad, we see it as bad. We get so hung up on like and dislike, on who’s right and who’s wrong, as if these labels were ultimately real. Yet the human experience is an experience of nothing to hang on to, nothing that’s set once and for all. Reality is always falling apart. In this fleeting situation, the only thing that makes sense is for us to reach out to one another.
</li><li>Good or bad, happy or sad, all thoughts vanish into emptiness like the imprint of a bird in the sky.
</li><li>And at bottom, those opinions are merely our efforts to escape the underlying uneasiness of being human, the uneasiness of feeling like we can’t get ground under our feet. So we hold on to our fixed ideas of this is how it is and disparage any opposing views.
</li><li>As Leonard Cohen once said about the benefits of many years of meditation, “The less there was of me, the happier I got.”
</li><li>IN TIBET, because the ground is frozen most of the year, earth burial is impossible. So when someone dies, the body is cut into pieces and taken to the charnel ground, the burial ground, where jackals and vultures and other birds of prey come and feed on the body parts. Strewn with limbs and eyeballs and entrails, the charnel ground is a grizzly place—hardly somewhere we would want to hang out.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Thursday, August 10, 2023 11:16:40 PM
</h4><ul><li>The single most vital step on your journey toward enlightenment is this: Learn to disidentify from your mind. Every time you create a gap in the stream of mind, the light of your consciousness grows stronger.
</li><li>You will observe that the future is usually imagined as either better or worse than the present. If the imagined future is better, it gives you hope or pleasurable anticipation. If it is worse, it creates anxiety. Both are illusory.
</li><li>Your life’s journey is no longer an adventure, just an obsessive need to arrive, to attain, to “make it.” You no longer see or smell the flowers by the wayside either, nor are you aware of the beauty and the miracle of life that unfolds all around you when you are present in the Now.
</li><li>To be free of time is to be free of the psychological need of the past for your identity and the future for your fulfillment.
</li><li>Ask yourself what “problem” you have right now, not next year, tomorrow, or five minutes from now. What is wrong with this moment?
</li><li>The compulsion to do, and the tendency to derive your sense of self-worth and identity from external factors such as achievement, is an inevitable illusion as long as you are identified with the mind.
</li><li>Compassion is the awareness of a deep bond between yourself and all creatures. Next time you say, “I have nothing in common with this person,” remember that you have a great deal in common: A few years from now — two years or seventy years, it doesn’t make much difference — both of you will have become rotting corpses, then piles of dust, then nothing at all.
</li><li>DO YOU WANT AN EASY DEATH? Would you rather die without pain, without agony? Then die to the past every moment, and let the light of your presence shine away the heavy, time-bound self you thought of as “you.”

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Thursday, August 10, 2023 11:56:44 PM
</h4><ul><li>How did I land into a life so foreign to my upbringing, but so familiar to my soul?
</li><li>Having better things than others made me feel embarassed. I idolized the poor and downtrodden.
</li><li>Someone gave me a book entitled The World’s Great Religions.
</li><li>I discovered an ancient Indian technique that taught silent meditation on the sacred syllable Om.
</li><li>One day, out of curiosity, Jim asked, “Monk, with the Vietnam War raging, how is it you never got drafted?” I told him how the draft board had accidently typed the wrong birthdate onto my records. Later, when the draft lottery was held and the nation watched, sitting on pins and needles, they pulled out one birth date after another. The early draws were the first to be drafted. My actual birthdate came up at the beginning of the draft but the mistaken one was drawn near the end and those called later were never called to service.
</li><li>“My child, there is one God. All religions teach us to love and obey him. Due to shallow faith, ego or politics, people fight over superficial differences.
</li><li>In Rome, as I had in so many other places, I found refuge on a riverbank. Looking across into the Tiber, I reflected on how this river had flowed through the rise and fall of the Roman Empire and ever since. Generations and civilizations had perished and the magnificent buildings of Rome had become ruins. But all the while the Tiber flowed on, carrying wisdom I longed to know.
</li><li>Hope in the divine can empower a human being to overcome unimaginable obstacles.
</li><li>“Son,” he began, “as long as I’m alive, I’m always here for you.” Stopping the car, he held my hand as his voice quivered, “As your father, I expect you to do your best, but whether you succeed or fail, do good or bad deeds, or even betray me, as long as I’m alive, I’ll love you and I’m here for you. This is a promise I will live and die to keep. Please, never forget this.”
</li><li>Although the dire poverty was disheartening, the people of Herat appeared to be the happiest, most carefree people I’d ever seen. This surreal combination of poverty and happiness short-circuited my intellect.
</li><li>It was unthinkable to hitchhike alone through the Khyber Pass, infamous as one of the most lawless lands on earth.
</li><li>He demonstrated, among other things, that he could consciously raise the temperature of a spot on the left side of his hand 10 degrees, slow his heart rate from 74 beats per minute to 52 in just 50 seconds, produce specific brain wave patterns on demand, consciously move a physical object half way across the room, and even stop his heart altogether.
</li><li>“There is only one cause for all our worries and anxieties. Selfishness.”
</li><li>He instructed me that we are beings of happiness, love, and light, but that we have forgotten this because we identified too much with our bodies and minds.
</li><li>“Man cannot be enlightened through any organization, creed, dogma, priest, or ritual, nor through any philosophic knowledge or psychological technique. He has to find it through understanding the contents of his own mind, through observation, not through intellectual analysis or introspective dissection.”
</li><li>“Life is meant for the realization of God,” he emphasized. “If you die without attaining God-realization, your life is in vain. You have wasted away this precious gift of human birth given to you by God.”
</li><li>He identified a common problem among spiritual practitioners—that one can do meditation in the morning and evening, but during the activities and dealings of the day, show petty-mindedness and selfishness. This, the Swami explained confidently, undid whatever one accomplished in the hours of meditation.
</li><li>Mother Ganges teaches us that if we want to attain the sea of our aspiration, we must persevere in our goal and never be discouraged by the inevitable obstacles that come on our path. All impediments are like rocks in the river of life. We should flow around them and never give up.
</li><li>As I sat on that rock, I imagined that watching the flow of the river was like watching the passing of life. If one is inside the river, one is greatly affected by it, but if one sits on the bank, one can observe it with detachment. Mother Ganges teaches that if we learn to be detached from our ego and the flurry of the mind, senses, and the world around us, and observe life with a sober disposition, we gain wisdom.
</li><li>At the time, I did not feel that these were my choices. I felt the mysterious hand of destiny leading me forward.
</li><li>From the river’s song emerged thousands of celestial voices, all chanting in unison the sacred syllable Om.
</li><li>ventured there with one rupee that a pilgrim had donated to me, then the equivalent of approximately twelve U.S. cents,
</li><li>Compared to the treasure of spiritual experience, worldly acquisition is like those peanuts, I thought to myself. People lie, cry, and die for a few of these peanuts. They fight and struggle for a handful. Wars are raged over them. But at any moment, a monkey, another’s greed, or even the inevitable march of time may plunder from us our cherished peanuts.
</li><li>The Maharishi Mahesh Yogi taught that, by practicing TM, our consciousness enters into finer and more subtle states. The goal is to enter a state more subtle than our ordinary states of wakefulness, sleep, and deep sleep. To meditate, then, is to experience a consciousness beyond the subtle existence of the mind and ego, for it is in that liberated state of pure being that we experience the eternal self.
</li><li>“The cause of all suffering is when we forget our identity with God. That is called Maya, or illusion.
</li><li>“With my own eyes, I have witnessed his power to read people’s minds, see into the future, and heal the sick. In fact, when a yogi had unbearable migraine headaches, Baba came to him in a dream, removed a white fluid from his head by mantra, and cured him forever.”
</li><li>Today the river is exposing how we have the tendency to judge others by their surface appearance, and to find only their negative qualities. But if we search beneath the surface we discover that a myriad of strains mix together to create a particular person’s nature. The faults we perceive are likely to be the effect of circumstances, the psychological response to trauma, abuse, rejection, heartbreak, insecurity, pain, confusion, or disease.
</li><li>If we understand the underlying cause of what we think of as bad in someone, instead of being hateful, we will be compassionate. For is not every soul inherently good? A saintly person will hate the disease but love the diseased.
</li><li>Unlike in the West, the begging of religious mendicants in rural India is considered an honorable way of life because the people receive so much in return from the sadhus they serve by giving alms.
</li><li>“Materially infected, you have more faith in modern science than your own heritage. God has brought me out of the forest to crush your foolish pride. By yogic power I will shut down all my life systems and die. You test me with your medical instruments. In exactly thirty minutes, I will rise from the dead.”
</li><li>Exactly thirty minutes later, to the second, the yogi exhaled, opened his eyes, stood up, and marched back into the jungles. He didn’t ask anything from anyone. He simply wanted to show these skeptics the power of yoga. Both the doctors and myself gazed in amazement at his departing form returning to the wilds.
</li><li>“Wisdom is to see everything in relation to the whole. If you understand that everything belongs to Him, you will be free of all burdens.”
</li><li>“All sorrow comes from the sense of I and mine. All sorrow is due to one’s keeping apart from God. When you are with Him all pain disappears. By sorrow does the Lord dispel sorrow and by adversity does He destroy adversity. When this is done He sends no more suffering, no more adversity. This must be remembered at all times.”
</li><li>Everywhere we look, we witness the unsurpassable miracles of God, but because we see them constantly, we take them for granted. Picking up a seed, I examined it. God has put a gigantic banyan tree in this tiny seed and each tree produces thousands more seeds. That’s a miracle. And in a single cloud, so light it floats in the air, He stores enough water to flood an entire city. When a male and female come together to procreate, they have no engineering plan on how the child will develop at each stage. It just happens. What a miracle. Every species of life is empowered with amazing talents, to fly, swim, run, climb trees, walk up walls, or create civilizations. Could all of this be happening by random chance? Creation is nothing but one amazing miracle after another.
</li><li>The Naga Baba sect has existed since the prehistoric past, and some Naga sects have fought as armies against Mughal and British conquerors, Buddhists, and even other sects of Hindus.
</li><li>As we spoke, Sean’s language, mannerisms, and interests seemed so crude and uninteresting. What was happening? I politely listened as he gossiped about people we knew, his views of world politics, places where he got high, and his bouts with dysentery, even down to the details of the texture of his stool. I wanted to run away. Less than a year ago, I enjoyed his company. Why was it so different now?
</li><li>It’s not the body that people love, but the soul. The body is a temporary vehicle. Without the soul, the body is like a car without a driver. I see through my eyes, smell through my nose, taste through my tongue, hear through my ears, feel through my skin, think through my brain, and love through my heart. But who am I? Who is the witness, enjoyer, and sufferer that activates my body?
</li><li>Regardless of race, sex, nationality, education, wealth, or religion, in due course, all bodies will be carried away by the river of time, the ultimate equalizer.
</li><li>Bodh Gaya, the holiest place on earth for Buddhists.
</li><li>“The source of all suffering is desire,” he began. “And desire arises from the mind’s attachments to the senses. Freedom is to empty the mind of all thoughts. To have no mind or thought is satori, the liberated state.”
</li><li>“The great D.T. Suzuki has written that the practice of Zen means a life of humility; a life of labor; a life of service; a life of prayer and gratitude; and a life of meditation.”
</li><li>“Through this meditation,” he said, “you will learn to observe life within and without, to witness it with neutrality, detached from the conceptions of pleasure or pain, success or failure, and happiness or distress. In this way, the mind gradually finds more and more subtle states of peace, and, from peace, compassion awakens.”
</li><li>One British woman asked Mother, “Why do you wash the pots? Is there not someone else who can do this?” Mother Theresa looked warmly on her interrogator. “Serving God and humanity is an honor, not a chore. Any type of service to God is a blessing. There is no high or low.”
</li><li>“We are singing the Maha Mantra or the great chanting for deliverance.” He then described that the name Hare was an invocation for Radha, the divine energy or female counterpart of the Lord. “It is she that is the origin and giver of the love of God. Krishna is a name of God that means He is all-attractive. And the name Rama means the Lord is the supreme enjoyer and bestows unending bliss to those who offer Him their love.” He went on to explain that transcendental sound vibration cleansed the heart of selfish desires and awakened our original, natural love for God, bringing about spiritual happiness.
</li><li>He confidently explained how true religion was not the property of any sect, caste, or creed, but the nature of all living beings. Our nature, he said, is to love God, but this love has been forgotten since time immemorial. Such love of God must be unconditional to completely satisfy the self. “We are spirit souls,” he said, “but in ignorance, we identify this temporary body with the self.”
</li><li>It is said that a saintly person is so pure that he or she acts like a spotless mirror. When we come in the presence of such a mirror-like soul, we can see both the beauty and ugliness of our inner life. Our faith and doubts, virtues and sins, strengths and weaknesses are revealed. It is both a joyful and painful experience, one that I had in the presence of Srila Prabhupada.
</li><li>We are all like fish that have separated from the sea of divine consciousness. For a person to be happy outside his or her natural relation with God is like a fish trying to enjoy life outside of the water, on the dry sand. Holy people go to great extremes to help even one person to return to his or her natural spiritual consciousness, to the sea of true joy. But the net of maya, or illusion, snatches away the minds of the masses, diverting us from our true self-interest.
</li><li>“The universal quality of religion,” he went on, “is compassion to other living beings.
</li><li>He explained to me that this caste system was actually a gross perversion of an ancient scriptural teaching, the vedic varnashram, which teaches that, just as the human body has a head, arms, belly, and legs, and each limb is meant to perform its function for the benefit of the whole body, in the social body, one is taught to accept responsibilities for the social and spiritual benefit of oneself as well as everyone in society according to one’s natural inclinations and skills. The Vedic varnashram was meant to encourage, empower, and unify everyone.
</li><li>The nature of the mind is to interpret nonessentials essential. The mind creates artificial needs, believing it cannot live without them. In this way we carry a great burden of attachments throughout our life. Attachment is itself a great burden on our minds. We may never understand the extent of the burden till, like my books or the earwax, we’re free of it. But if we find joy within, we can live a simple life, free of endless complications.
</li><li>I had once heard an old analogy from the American Indians, and it came to my mind now. Within every heart dwell two dogs, a bad dog and a good dog, both at battle with one another. The bad dog represents our debased tendencies of envy, anger, lust, greed, arrogance, and illusion. The good dog, our divine nature, is represented by forgiveness, compassion, self-control, generosity, humility, and wisdom. Whichever dog we feed the most through the choices we make and the utilization of our time will empower that dog to bark the loudest and conquer the other.
</li><li>“Love everyone, serve everyone, and feed everyone. Serve like Hanuman without selfishness and greed. This is the key to realizing God.”
</li><li>In real humility there is a deeper principle than our sad need to feel superior to others. That higher principle prevents us from being arrogant and condescending toward those we feel are inferior. It protects us from being envious towards those who are more accomplished. When one is humble, one feels grateful and gives credit to the Lord and all those who have ever offered help. With a humble heart one can easily admit mistakes and open one’s heart to learn. Becoming humble is not the act of killing the ego but of liberating the real ego, which is eternally vibrant with love for God and others.
</li><li>This cold, dusty riverbank in Vrindavan is many times more precious to me than a palatial mansion in the country of my birth.
</li><li>“Whether one power or another rules is a temporary situation. The eternal reality is that we are not these bodily designations but the soul who is eternal and full of bliss. Real welfare work, whether individual, social, or political, should help a person to reestablish his eternal relationship with the Supreme Reality, Lord Krishna.”
</li><li>“The basic principle of the living condition is that we have a general propensity to love someone,” he began. “No one can live without loving someone else. This propensity is present in every living being. The missing piece, however, is where to direct our love so that everyone is included and can be happy.”
</li><li>“Everything is potentially spiritual,” Srila Prabhupada began, as if picking up from my own waking thoughts. “Everything is the energy of the Lord. Material consciousness is to forget an object’s relationship with God. Spiritual consciousness is to see everything in relation to God and utilize everything in devotional service.”
</li><li>Perhaps God, I thought, reveals true love to the world through the lives of those who love Him.

</h4><ul><li>Perhaps I may analogize this by supposing that four men approach an inaccessible mountain from different directions, and each writes a faithful description of the mountain as he sees it. Inevitably they will differ widely in detail and in opinion as to the best way to reach the summit, and although each account will be true as far as it goes, none will give a true picture of the mountain as a whole. But by putting the four accounts together, each taking from the others what it lacks, surely a much closer approximation to the whole will be achieved.
</li><li>For I am committed to the view that the whole point and joy of human life is to integrate the spiritual with the material, the mystical with the sensuous, and the altruistic with a kind of proper self-love—since it is written that you must love your neighbor as yourself.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Saturday, August 19, 2023 12:05:41 PM
</h4><ul><li>At the age of eighteen, I had encountered a lot of people who were rich. I’d listened to a lot of people who were famous, strong, good-looking, or all three. But I don’t think I’d met anyone who was truly happy.
</li><li>I felt the urge to be around people who had the values I wanted, not the things I wanted.
</li><li>Researchers who scanned Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard’s brain subsequently labeled him “the World’s Happiest Man” after they found the highest level of gamma waves—those associated with attention, memory, learning, and happiness—ever recorded by science.
</li><li>The Bhagavad Gita is considered a kind of universal and timeless life manual.
</li><li>Eknath Easwaran, spiritual author and professor who has translated many of India’s sacred texts, including the Bhagavad Gita, calls it “India’s most important gift to the world.” In his 1845 journal, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “I owed—my friend and I owed—a magnificent day to the Bhagavat Geeta [sic]. It was the first of books; it was as if an empire spoke to us, nothing small or unworthy, but large, serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence which in another age and climate had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which exercise us.”
</li><li>“Because the only thing that stays with you from the moment you’re born until the moment you die is your breath. All your friends, your family, the country you live in, all of that can change. The one thing that stays with you is your breath.”
</li><li>This ten-year-old monk added, “When you get stressed—what changes? Your breath. When you get angry—what changes? Your breath. We experience every emotion with the change of the breath. When you learn to navigate and manage your breath, you can navigate any situation in life.”
</li><li>I will introduce you to three very different types of meditation that I recommend including in your practice: breathwork, visualization, and sound. All three have benefits, but the simplest way to differentiate them is to know that you do breathwork for the physical benefits—to find stillness and balance, to calm yourself; visualization for the psychological benefits—to heal the past and prepare for the future; and chanting for the psychic benefits—to connect with your deepest self and the universe, for real purification.
</li><li>Charles Horton Cooley wrote: “I am not what I think I am, and I am not what you think I am. I am what I think you think I am.”
</li><li>How can we recognize who we are and what makes us happy when we’re chasing the distorted reflection of someone else’s dreams?
</li><li>When you try to live your most authentic life, some of your relationships will be put in jeopardy. Losing them is a risk worth bearing; finding a way to keep them in your life is a challenge worth taking on.
</li><li>Society’s definition of a happy life is everybody’s and nobody’s. The only way to build a meaningful life is to filter out that noise and look within.
</li><li>Observing and evaluating are key to thinking like a monk, and they begin with space and stillness.
</li><li>When we tune out the opinions, expectations, and obligations of the world around us, we begin to hear ourselves.
</li><li>There are three ways I suggest you actively create space for reflection. First, on a daily basis I recommend you sit down to reflect on how the day went and what emotions you’re feeling. Second, once a month you can approximate the change that I found at the ashram by going someplace you’ve never been before to explore yourself in a different environment. This can be anything from visiting a park or library you’ve never been to before to taking a trip. Finally, get involved in something that’s meaningful to you—a hobby, a charity, a political cause.
</li><li>According to the Gita, these are the higher values and qualities: fearlessness, purity of mind, gratitude, service and charity, acceptance, performing sacrifice, deep study, austerity, straightforwardness, nonviolence, truthfulness, absence of anger, renunciation, perspective, restraint from fault finding, compassion toward all living beings, satisfaction, gentleness/kindness, integrity, determination.
</li><li>For the next week, whenever you spend money on a nonnecessity or make a plan for how you will spend your free time, pause, and think: What is the value behind this choice? It only takes a second, a flash of consideration. Ideally, this momentary pause becomes instinctive, so that you are making conscious choices about what matters to you and how much energy you devote to it.
</li><li>Every time you move homes or take a different job or embark on a new relationship, you have a golden opportunity to reinvent yourself.
</li><li>If a friend who lives within a mile of you becomes happier, then the chance that you are also happy increases by 25 percent.
</li><li>“Cancers of the Mind: Comparing, Complaining, Criticizing.”
</li><li>One of the exercises we did was keeping a tally of every criticism we spoke or thought. For each one, we had to write down ten good things about the person.
</li><li>We think that complaining will help us process our anger, but research confirms that even people who report feeling better after venting are still more aggressive post-gripe than people who did not engage in venting.
</li><li>“There is no commandment that says we have to be upset by the way other people treat us. The reason we are upset is because we have an emotional program that says, ‘If someone is nasty to me, I cannot be happy or feel good about myself.’… Instead of reacting compulsively and retaliating, we could enjoy our freedom as human beings and refuse to be upset.”
</li><li>Thich Nhat Hanh, a Buddhist monk who has been called the Father of Mindfulness, writes, “Letting go gives us freedom, and freedom is the only condition for happiness. If, in our heart, we still cling to anything—anger, anxiety, or possessions—we cannot be free.”
</li><li>The more we define ourselves in relation to the people around us, the more lost we are.
</li><li>I thought of something the Dalai Lama said, “If you think you are too small to make a difference, try sleeping with a mosquito.”
</li><li>To purify our thoughts, monks talk about the process of awareness, addressing, and amending. I like to remember this as spot, stop, swap. First, we become aware of a feeling or issue—we spot it. Then we pause to address what the feeling is and where it comes from—we stop to consider it. And last, we amend our behavior—we swap in a new way of processing the moment. SPOT, STOP, SWAP.
</li><li>The Bhagavad Gita refers to the austerity of speech, saying that we should only speak words that are truthful, beneficial to all, pleasing, and that don’t agitate the minds of others.
</li><li>If I only find joy in my own successes, I’m limiting my joy. But if I can take pleasure in the successes of my friends and family—ten, twenty, fifty people!—I get to experience fifty times the happiness and joy. Who doesn’t want that?
</li><li>When you squeeze an orange, you get orange juice. When you squeeze someone full of pain, pain comes out. Instead of absorbing it or giving it back, if you forgive, you help diffuse the pain.
</li><li>The less time you fixate on everyone else, the more time you have to focus on yourself.
</li><li>The longer we hold on to fears, the more they ferment until eventually they become toxic.
</li><li>Our real problem is that we fear the wrong things: What we should really fear is that we will miss the opportunities that fear offers.
</li><li>In the words of Śāntideva, “It is not possible to control all external events; but if I simply control my mind, what need is there to control other things?”
</li><li>You see, deep breathing activates a part of our nervous system called the vagus nerve, which in turn stimulates a relaxation response throughout our bodies. The simple act of controlled breathing is like flipping a switch that shifts our nervous system from the sympathetic, or fight-flight-freeze, state to the parasympathetic, or rest-and-digest, state, allowing our mind and body to get back in synch.
</li><li>When we let achievements and acquisitions determine our course, we’re living in the illusion that happiness comes from external measures of success, but all too often we find that when we finally get what we want, when we find success, it doesn’t lead to happiness.
</li><li>Jim Carrey once said, “I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of, so they can see that it’s not the answer.”
</li><li>When monks talk about happiness, they tell the story of the musk deer, a tale derived from a poem by Kabir, a fifteenth-century Indian mystic and poet. The musk deer picks up an irresistible scent in the forest and chases it, searching for the source, not realizing that the scent comes from its own pores. It spends its whole life wandering fruitlessly.
</li><li>The more we upgrade from trying to fulfill our selfish needs to doing things out of service and love, the more we can achieve.
</li><li>As Benedictine monk Laurence Freeman said in his book Aspects of Love, “Everything you do in the day from washing to eating breakfast, having meetings, driving to work… watching television or deciding instead to read… everything you do is your spiritual life. It is only a matter of how consciously you do these ordinary things…” LIVE YOUR INTENTIONS Of course, simply having intentions isn’t enough. We have to take action to help those seeds grow. I don’t believe in wishful “manifesting,” the idea that if you simply believe something will happen, it will. We can’t sit around with true intentions expecting that what we want will fall into our laps. Nor can we expect someone to find us, discover how amazing we are, and hand us our place in the world. Nobody is going to create our lives for us. Martin Luther King Jr., said, “Those who love peace must learn to organize as effectively as those who love war.” When people come to me seeking guidance, I constantly hear, “I wish… I wish… I wish…” I wish my partner would be more attentive. I wish I could have the same job but make more money. I wish my relationship were more serious. We never say, “I wish I could be more organized and focused and could do the hard work to get that.” We don’t vocalize what it would actually take to get what we want. “I wish” is code for “I don’t want to do anything differently.” There’s an apocryphal story about Picasso that perfectly illustrates how we fail to recognize the work and perseverance behind achievement. As the tale goes, a woman sees Picasso in a market. She goes up to him and says, “Would you mind drawing something for me?” “Sure,” he says, and thirty seconds later hands her a remarkably beautiful little sketch. “That will be thirty thousand dollars,” he says. “But Mr. Picasso,” the woman says, “how can you charge me so much? This drawing only took you thirty seconds!” “Madame,” says Picasso, “it took me thirty years.” The same is true of any artistic work—or, indeed, any job that’s done well. The effort behind it is invisible. The monk in my ashram who could easily recite all the scriptures put years into memorizing them. I needed to consider that investment, the life it required, before making it my goal. When asked who we are, we resort to stating what we do: “I’m an accountant.” “I’m a lawyer.” “I’m a housewife/househusband.” “I’m an athlete.” “I’m a teacher.” Sometimes this is just a useful way to jump-start a conversation with someone you’ve just met. But
</li><li>As Benedictine monk Laurence Freeman said in his book Aspects of Love, “Everything you do in the day from washing to eating breakfast, having meetings, driving to work… watching television or deciding instead to read… everything you do is your spiritual life. It is only a matter of how consciously you do these ordinary things…”
</li><li>“I wish” is code for “I don’t want to do anything differently.”
</li><li>In the Dhammapada the Buddha says, “As a fish hooked and left on the sand thrashes about in agony, the mind being trained in meditation trembles all over.”
</li><li>Saint Francis of Assisi: “Preach the Gospel at all times. When necessary, use words.”
</li><li>I am beginning to realize my dharma—studying, experimenting with knowledge, and speaking.
</li><li>You can’t be anything you want. But you can be everything you are.
</li><li>The Bhagavad Gita says that it’s better to do one’s own dharma imperfectly than to do another’s perfectly. Or, as Steve Jobs put it in his 2005 Stanford commencement address, “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.”
</li><li>Take note of every activity you take part in through the course of a few days. Meetings, walking the dog, lunch with a friend, writing emails, preparing food, exercising, spending time on social media. For every activity, answer the two questions fundamental to dharma: Did I enjoy the process? Did other people enjoy the result? There are no right or wrong answers. This is an observation exercise to amplify your awareness.
</li><li>In Buddhism, the lotus represents the idea that the mud and muck of life’s challenges can provide fertile ground for our development. As the lotus grows, it rises through the water to eventually blossom. The Buddha says, “Just like a red, blue, or white lotus—born in the water, grown in the water, rising up above the water—stands unsmeared by the water, in the same way I—born in the world, grown in the world, having overcome the world—live unsmeared by the world.”
</li><li>The point of waking up early wasn’t to torture us—it was to start the day off with peace and tranquility. Birds. A gong. The sound of flowing water.
</li><li>When you start the morning with high pressure and high stress, you’re programming your body to operate in that mode for the rest of the day, through conversations, meetings, appointments.
</li><li>If you spend your morning making trivial decisions, you’ll have squandered that energy. Settle into patterns and make decisions the night before, and you’ll have a head start on the morning and will be better able to make focused decisions throughout the day.
</li><li>The emotion you fall asleep with at night is most likely the emotion you’ll wake up with in the morning.
</li><li>Try starting a conversation with someone you see regularly but haven’t ever engaged. Do this with one new person every day and see how your life changes.
</li><li>If I am incapable of washing dishes joyfully, if I want to finish them quickly so I can go and have dessert or a cup of tea, I will be equally incapable of enjoying my dessert or my tea when I finally have them.…
</li><li>There is a Zen koan that says, “Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water.”
</li><li>Location has energy; time has memory. If you do something at the same time every day, it becomes easier and natural. If you do something in the same space every day, it becomes easier and natural.
</li><li>As Lisa Feldman Barrett, author of How Emotions Are Made, describes it on a podcast, most of the time “your brain is not reacting to events in the world, it’s predicting… constantly guessing what’s going to happen next.”
</li><li>A senior monk once told me an old Cherokee story about these dilemmas which all of us agonize over: “An elder tells his grandson, ‘Every choice in life is a battle between two wolves inside us. One represents anger, envy, greed, fear, lies, insecurity, and ego. The other represents peace, love, compassion, kindness, humility, and positivity. They are competing for supremacy.’ “ ‘Which wolf wins?’ the grandson asks. ‘The one you feed,’ the elder replies.” “But how do we feed them?” I asked my teacher. The monk said, “By what we read and hear. By who we spend time with. By what we do with our time. By where we focus our energy and attention.”
</li><li>Eknath Easwaran writes that in our everyday swirl of thoughts “we have no more idea of what life is really like than a chicken has before it hatches. Excitement and depression, fortune and misfortune, pleasure and pain, are storms in a tiny, private, shell-bound realm which we take to be the whole of existence.” It makes sense, then, that when the Buddha finally reached “the realm utterly beyond the reach of thought,” he described feeling like a chick breaking out of its shell.
</li><li>When your mind is anxious and racing, when your thoughts are repetitive and unproductive, when you feel like you need to press pause, take fifteen minutes to write down every thought that enters your mind.
</li><li>Treat yourself with the same love and respect you want to show to others.
</li><li>We are defined by the narrative that we write for ourselves every day. Is it a story of joy, perseverance, love, and kindness, or is it a story of guilt, blame, bitterness, and failure?
</li><li>Father Richard Rohr writes, “All spiritual teaching—this is not an oversimplification—is about how to be present to the moment.…
</li><li>When you trust the false ego to protect you, it’s like wearing armor that you thought was made of steel but is actually made of paper.
</li><li>The ego doesn’t want to be better. It wants to be seen as better. When we bluff our way through life, pretending to be who we are not, we end up looking worse than we truly are.
</li><li>When salt is used in the best way possible, it goes unrecognized. Salt is so humble that when something goes wrong, it takes the blame, and when everything goes right, it doesn’t take credit.
</li><li>“What belongs to you today, belonged to someone yesterday and will be someone else’s tomorrow.”
</li><li>The most powerful, admirable, captivating quality in any human is seen when they’ve achieved great things, but still embrace humility and their own insignificance.
</li><li>Scientists at the Cleveland Clinic showed that people who imagined contracting a muscle in their little finger over twelve weeks increased its strength by almost as much as people who did actual finger exercises over the same period of time.
</li><li>The health benefits of gratitude are so extensive that Dr. P. Murali Doraiswamy, head of the Division of Biologic Psychology at Duke University Medical Center, told ABC News, “If [thankfulness] were a drug, it would be the world’s best-selling product with a health maintenance indication for every major organ system.”
</li><li>One in every nine people on earth do not have enough food to eat every day. That’s nearly 800 million people.
</li><li>I want you to be grateful in all times and circumstances. Even if your life isn’t perfect, build your gratitude like a muscle. If you train it now, it will only strengthen over time.
</li><li>Don’t judge the moment. As soon as you label something as bad, your mind starts to believe it. Instead, be grateful for setbacks. Allow the journey of life to progress at its own pace and in its own roundabout way. The universe may have other plans in store for you.
</li><li>‘What’s the opportunity in this moment?’ You look for it and then take advantage of that opportunity. It’s as simple as that.”
</li><li>But also, listen carefully. Whenever you give out any energy—love, hate, anger, kindness—you will always get it back. One way or another. Love is like a circle. Whatever love you give out, it always comes back to you. The problem lies with your expectations. You assume the love you receive will come from the person you gave it to. But it doesn’t always come from that person. Similarly, there are people who love you who you don’t give the same love in return.”
</li><li>When researchers combed through the data, they found a single factor that reliably predicted the quality of participants’ lives: love. Participants could have every other external marker for success—money, a thriving career, good physical health—but if they didn’t have loving relationships, they weren’t happy.
</li><li>Neil deGrasse Tyson said, “We are all connected; to each other, biologically. To the Earth, chemically. And to the rest of the universe, atomically.”
</li><li>“Plant trees under whose shade you do not plan to sit.”
</li><li>The highest purpose is to live in service.
</li><li>We seek to leave a place cleaner than we found it, people happier than we found them, the world better than we found it.
</li><li>We remember that we never know what someone is going through, so we treat them with the gentleness you would give someone who is in pain, with the generosity you would give someone who is hungry, with the compassion you would give someone who is misunderstood.
</li><li>When we traveled, we always carried extra food with us so that we had some to give away.
</li><li>Charity isn’t giving of yourself. You’re taking something that was already on earth and giving it back to earth. You don’t have to have to give.
</li><li>In a series of experiments, researchers at University of California, Berkeley, found that people with less money actually tend to give more.
</li><li>Here’s the life hack: Service is always the answer. It fixes a bad day. It tempers the burdens we bear. Service helps other people and helps us. We don’t expect anything in return, but what we get is the joy of service. It’s an exchange of love. When you’re living in service, you don’t have time to complain and criticize. When you’re living in service, your fears go away. When you’re living in service, you feel grateful. Your material attachments diminish. Service is the direct path to a meaningful life.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Thursday, August 24, 2023 9:47:55 PM
</h4><ul><li>Li Ching-Yuen, the martial artist whose 256-year-long life began in 1677 and included 14 wives and over 200 children before he died in 1933,
</li><li>The key to the yogi’s teaching is this: when we experience for ourselves, or witness in another person, something that we’ve once believed to be impossible, we are freed in our beliefs to transcend those limitations in our own lives.
</li><li>When the fight-or-flight nervous system is switched on and stays on because of chronic stress, the body utilizes all its energy reserves to deal with the constant threat it perceives from the outer environment. Therefore, the body has no energy left in its inner environment for growth and repair, compromising the immune system.
</li><li>I now realize that the expectation of the same outcome, combined with the frustration of trying to force it to happen, is the worst combination for creating another mystical experience (or anything, for that matter).
</li><li>Each of us has myriad possible incarnations that exist in the eternal present moment, all waiting to be discovered. When the mystery of the self is unveiled, we can wake up to the understanding that we are not linear beings living a linear life but instead dimensional beings living dimensional lives.
</li><li>When you think a thought (or have a memory), a biochemical reaction begins in your brain causing the brain to release certain chemical signals. That’s how immaterial thoughts literally become matter—they become chemical messengers. These chemical signals make your body feel exactly the way you were just thinking. Once you notice you are feeling a particular way, then you generate more thoughts equal to how you’re feeling, and then you release more chemicals from your brain to make you feel the way you’ve been thinking.
</li><li>Given what you just learned about feelings and emotions being the chemical end products of past events, the moment you wake up in the morning and search for the familiar feeling called you, you are starting your day in the past.
</li><li>If where you place your attention is where you place your energy, the moment you put your attention on familiar feelings and memories, you are siphoning your energy into the past and out of the present moment.
</li><li>So as you read earlier in this chapter, this means that if you’re living by the same emotions day in and day out, your body believes it’s in the same environmental conditions. Then those feelings influence you to make the same choices, causing you to demonstrate the same habits that then create the same experiences that then produce the same emotions all over again.
</li><li>When stress levels (and therefore the levels of stress hormones like cortisol) go up, this lowers levels of IgA, thereby compromising and down-regulating the immune system’s expression of the gene that makes this protein.
</li><li>The only thing I can assure you of is this: The unknown has never let me down.
</li><li>It is this process of continuously returning to the present moment every time you become aware that you’ve lost it that begins to break the energetic bonds with your familiar known reality.
</li><li>Every time I’ve labored—sometimes for hours—to get beyond myself and find that place called the eternal now, and I truly break through, I’ve always thought the same thing: That was so worth it.
</li><li>So everything in our known universe, although it may appear to be solid, is actually 99.999999999999 percent energy or information.1 In fact, most of the universe is made up of this “empty” space; matter is an infinitesimally small component in relation to the immense space of nothing physical.
</li><li>It is only when an observer focuses his or her attention and looks for some “thing” material that the invisible field of energy and information collapses into a particle we know as the electron. That is called collapsing the wave function, or a quantum event. But as soon as the observer looks away, no longer observing the electron and taking his or her mind off the subatomic matter, it disappears back into energy. In other words, that particle of physical matter (the electron) can’t exist until we observe it—give it our attention.
</li><li>At that point, we are simply observing what already exists in the quantum field of all possibilities or potentials and bringing it to life with our attention and our energy.
</li><li>And if you think you won’t know how it’s going to feel because you haven’t experienced it yet, then try gratitude—that works really well. Gratitude is a powerful emotion to use for manifesting because normally we feel gratitude after we receive something. So the emotional signature of gratitude means it has already happened.
</li><li>The visible light spectrum—where we perceive the various array of colors present in this world we live in—makes up less than 1 percent of all the frequencies of light that exist.
</li><li>Probably the most famous example is the story of Claire Sylvia, who wrote a book called A Change of Heart about her experiences after receiving a heart and lung transplant in 1988.6 All she knew at the time was that her new organs came from an 18-year-old male donor who had died in a motorcycle accident. After the transplant, the 47-year-old professional dancer and choreographer developed cravings for chicken nuggets, French fries, beer, green peppers, and Snickers bars, none of which were foods she had enjoyed before.
</li><li>The most dramatic story illustrating this involves an 8-year-old girl who, after receiving a heart transplant from a 10-year-old girl, began having vivid nightmares about being murdered.7 The donor had indeed been murdered, and the perpetrator had not been caught. The patient’s mother took her to a psychiatrist who was convinced that the girl was dreaming about events that had actually occurred. They contacted the police, who opened an investigation using the girl’s detailed account of the murder, including information on the time and place of the crime, the weapon, the physical characteristics of the criminal, and the clothing the murderer was wearing. The killer was identified, arrested, and convicted.
</li><li>It is a scientific fact that we use about 1.5 percent of our DNA. The rest is called junk DNA.
</li><li>Over the years, I’ve found that stories serve a great purpose: to reinforce information in a practical manner. Hearing about someone else’s experience makes it more real for us.
</li><li>For instance, at the turn of the 20th century, hardly anyone died of heart disease, while today it’s the leading cause of death for both men and women.
</li><li>In a fetus, the heart begins beating before the brain is even formed (at about three weeks), while the electrical activity of its brain doesn’t even begin until around the fifth or sixth week.
</li><li>In 1991, the pioneering work of J. Andrew Armour, M.D., Ph.D., showed that the heart literally has a mind of its own. With as many as 40,000 neurons, the heart has a nervous system that functions independently of the brain.

</li><li>A good rule of thumb: Don’t watch anything on television or on the Internet or participate in any mode of entertainment that you don’t want to experience—not only before bed, but ever.
</li><li>So for you to truly make changes in your life, you would have to step into the unknown—and if you don’t, nothing ever really changes.
</li><li>To get an understanding of just how small these subatomic particles are, if the nucleus of an atom were increased to the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, the size of the electron would be equal to the size of a pea. Meanwhile, the space where the electron could exist would be 85,000 square miles—that’s twice the size of Cuba. That’s a lot of empty space for the electron to exist in.
</li><li>What converts matter to energy is the speed of light—which means anything material traveling faster than the speed of light leaves our three-dimensional reality and turns into immaterial energy. In other words, in the three-dimensional world the speed of light is the threshold for matter—or anything physical—to retain its form.
</li><li>For instance, you are not aware of your big toe on your left foot until you put your attention on it. It has always existed for you but you were unaware of it. The moment you put your awareness on it, however, it comes into being. The same is true for the unified field. The more you become aware of it, the more it will exist in your reality.
</li><li>Simply by placing your attention on the unified field—as you become aware of it, notice it, experience it, feel it, interact with it, and stay present with it moment after moment—it shows up and unfolds in your reality on a daily basis. How does it show up and unfold? As unknowns: serendipities, synchronicities, opportunities, coincidences, luck, being in the right place at the right time, and moments filled with awe.
</li><li>In a 24-hour cycle, the production of melatonin is highest between the hours of 1 A.M. and 4 A.M. This is important to remember.
</li><li>Alter melatonin one more time and you produce the chemical dimethyltryptamine (DMT), one of the most powerful hallucinogenic substances known to man.
</li><li>A powerful example is the Lebanon peace project, which brought together a group of meditators in Jerusalem in August and September of 1983 to demonstrate the “radiating influence of peace.” Although the number of meditators fluctuated over time, it was often large enough to achieve the super radiance effect for both Israel and nearby Lebanon. This effect happens when a group of specially trained meditators come together at the same time on a daily basis to create and radiate a positive effect on society. The results of the two-month study showed that on days when there was a high participation of meditators, a 76 percent reduction of war deaths occurred.
</li><li>In what’s considered one of the top three peace-gathering studies in the Western hemisphere, a RAND Corporation think tank assembled a group of nearly 8,000 (and sometimes more) trained meditators to focus on world peace and coherence during three periods ranging from 8 to 11 days each, from 1983 to 1985. The results showed that during this time, worldwide terrorism was reduced by 72 percent.4 Can you imagine the results and positive effects, as
</li><li>For the most part humans are electromagnetic beings (entities that constantly send and receive messages via vibrational energies) whose bodies are made up of gravitationally organized light and information. (In fact, everything material in this three-dimensional world is gravitationally organized light and information.) Just as we are individual electromagnetic beings, we are but a small link in the chain of an electromagnetic world, the individual parts of which cannot be separated from the whole.
</li><li>In fact, as you know by now, the heart generates the strongest magnetic field in the body and it can be measured several feet away.15 This provides a credible explanation for the fact that when someone walks into a room, you can feel or sense that individual’s mood or emotional state, independent of their body language.
</li><li>What I hope you take away from this book is that it’s not enough to change your state of being only when you meditate. It’s not sufficient to just think and feel peace with your eyes closed, and then open them and carry on throughout the day in limited, unconscious states of mind and body.
</li><li>Thanks to mirror neurons (a special class of brain cells that fire when we see someone perform an action), we are biologically wired to mimic each other’s behavior. Modeling peace, justice, love, kindness, care, understanding, and compassion allows others to open their hearts and move from fearful, aggressive states of survival to feeling wholeness and connectedness.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Thursday, August 31, 2023 10:55:59 AM
</h4><ul><li>So if you ask the question “What kinds of perceptions and thoughts and feelings guide us through life each day?” the answer, at the most basic level, isn’t “The kinds of thoughts and feelings and perceptions that give us an accurate picture of reality.” No, at the most basic level the answer is “The kinds of thoughts and feelings and perceptions that helped our ancestors get genes into the next generation.”
</li><li>One of the Buddha’s main messages was that the pleasures we seek evaporate quickly and leave us thirsting for more.
</li><li>Indeed, though the Buddha is famous for asserting that life is pervaded by suffering, some scholars say that’s an incomplete rendering of his message and that the word translated as “suffering,” dukkha, could, for some purposes, be translated as “unsatisfactoriness.”
</li><li>Natural selection doesn’t “want” us to be happy, after all; it just “wants” us to be productive, in its narrow sense of productive. And the way to make us productive is to make the anticipation of pleasure very strong but the pleasure itself not very long-lasting.
</li><li>As any good meditation teacher will tell you, if you talk about meditation in terms of success or failure, you’re misunderstanding what meditation is.
</li><li>This is something that can happen again and again via meditation: accepting, even embracing, an unpleasant feeling can give you a critical distance from it that winds up diminishing the unpleasantness.
</li><li>In fact, one of the take-home lessons of Buddhist philosophy is that feelings just are. If we accepted their arising and subsiding as part of life, rather than reacting to them as if they were deeply meaningful, we’d often be better off. Learning to do that is a big part of what mindfulness meditation is about.
</li><li>As for the cost: I’d guess that chasing somebody in a car at eighty miles per hour is more likely to get you killed than was starting a fistfight in a hunter-gatherer society.
</li><li>Though your brief conviction that you’ve seen a rattlesnake may be wrong ninety-nine times out of a hundred, the conviction could be lifesaving the other one time in a hundred. And in natural selection’s calculus, being right 1 percent of the time in matters of life or death can be worth being wrong 99 percent of the time, even if in every one of those ninety-nine instances you’re briefly terrified.
</li><li>Modern life is full of emotional reactions that make little sense except in light of the environment in which our species evolved.
</li><li>As Aaron Beck, who is sometimes called the founder of cognitive-behavioral therapy, has written, “The cost of survival of the lineage may be a lifetime of discomfort.”
</li><li>The first time I entered the dining hall at mealtime, I was puzzled as to why so many people were eating with their eyes closed. Before long I got the picture: shuttering the visual field brought absorption in taste closer to 100 percent. The result was sublime. A single bite of salad—chewed slowly, savored not just for flavor but for texture—could bring fifteen seconds of near bliss.
</li><li>I sometimes tell people that going on a long meditation retreat is like doing extreme sports for the mind: it features both the sublime and the harrowing. I’m happy to say that in my experience the ratio is about 4 to 1.
</li><li>Still, if you want to go full-on Buddhist—if you want to take the red pill—you need to understand that staying in the present, though an inherent part of mindfulness meditation, isn’t the point of the exercise. It is the means to an end, not the end itself.
</li><li>He conducts this search systematically; he goes through what are known as the five “aggregates” that, according to Buddhist philosophy, constitute a human being and that human’s experience. Describing these aggregates precisely would take a chapter in itself, but for present purposes we can label them roughly as (1) the physical body (called “form” in this discourse), including such sense organs as eyes and ears; (2) basic feelings; (3) perceptions (of, say, identifiable sights or sounds); (4) “mental formations” (a big category that includes complex emotions, thoughts, inclinations, habits, decisions); and (5) “consciousness,” or awareness—notably, awareness of the contents of the other four aggregates. The Buddha runs down this list and asks which, if any, of these five aggregates seem to qualify as self.
</li><li>The scholar Peter Harvey has written, “One can, then, perhaps see the Self idea as fulfilling a role akin to a rocket which boosts a payload into space, against the force of gravity. It provides the force to drive the mind out of the ‘gravity field’ of attachment to the personality-factors [the aggregates]. Having done so, it then ‘falls away and is burnt up,’ as itself a baseless concept.”
</li><li>There’s roughly no chance that all the sayings attributed to him in Buddhist texts were uttered by him. In fact, some scholars will tell you that there is little or nothing in these texts that we can confidently attribute to him. Like the “historical Jesus,” the “historical Buddha” is hard to discern through the mists of history. Just as the gospel accounts of Jesus are products of evolution, of oral and textual accretion over time, so are ancient accounts of the Buddha’s utterances. Even assuming that most of these accounts were originally grounded in things he actually said, they were subject to amendment, intentional or not, as they passed through the generations. In this light, it’s hardly surprising that there should be inconsistencies and outright contradictions within the Buddhist canon.
</li><li>In a famous series of experiments first done in the early 1980s by Benjamin Libet, researchers monitored the brains of subjects while they “chose” to initiate an action. The researchers concluded that the brain was initiating the action before the person became aware of “deciding” to initiate it.
</li><li>What’s more, when we recount an experience to someone, the act of recounting it changes the memory of it. So if we reshape the story a bit each time—omitting inconvenient facts, exaggerating convenient ones—we can, over time, transform our actual belief about what happened.
</li><li>In other words, if you were to build into the brain a component in charge of public relations, it would look something like the conscious self. The anthropologist Jerome Barkow has written, “It is possible to argue that the primary evolutionary function of the self is to be the organ of impression management (rather than, as our folk psychology would have it, a decision-maker).”
</li><li>“Whichever notion you happened to be conscious of at a particular moment is the one that comes bubbling up, the one that becomes dominant,” writes Gazzaniga. “It’s a dog-eat-dog world going on in your brain, with different systems competing to make it to the surface to win the prize of conscious recognition.”
</li><li>So we have three things that can change about people who sense a mating opportunity: they can become crowd-averse, suddenly partial to intimate environments; their intertemporal utility function can get recalibrated; and their career goals, at least for the time being, can become more materialistic.
</li><li>Buddhist thought and modern psychology converge on this point: in human life as it’s ordinarily lived, there is no one self, no conscious CEO, that runs the show; rather, there seem to be a series of selves that take turns running the show—and, in a sense, seizing control of the show.
</li><li>When your mind is wandering, it may feel like, well, like your mind is wandering—like it’s strolling along the landscape of modules and sampling them, indulging one module for a while, then eventually moving on to another one. But another way to describe it is to say that, actually, the different modules are competing for your attention, and when the mind “wanders” from one module to another, what’s actually happening is that the second module has acquired enough strength to wrestle control of your consciousness away from the first module.
</li><li>One way to get the idea, Goldstein said, is to “imagine that every thought that’s arising in your mind is coming from the person next to you.” How would you be relating to these thoughts then? His point was that you wouldn’t be identifying with them. “The thought itself is appearing and disappearing like a sound, but being identified with it is something we’re adding.”
</li><li>It’s sort of like going to the movies. We go to the movies and there’s a very absorbing story and we’re pulled into the story and we feel so many emotions . . . excited, afraid, in love. . . . And then we sit back and see these are just pixels of light projected on a screen. Everything we thought is happening is not really happening. It’s the same way with our thoughts. We get caught up in the story, in the drama of them, forgetting their essentially insubstantial nature.”
</li><li>“When we have that basis of wisdom about the nature of thought, then we have more power to choose, okay, which thoughts are healthy . . . which thoughts are not so healthy—those we can let go.”
</li><li>Buddhist monk named Akincano Marc Weber. One night during a dharma talk, he said, “Every thought has a propellant, and that propellant is emotional.”
</li><li>Brain-scan studies have shown that the same parts of the brain that mediate physical pain also mediate the pain of social rejection. Which helps explain why opiates and other painkillers can take the sting out of social setbacks. Even extended doses of Tylenol, one study showed, can dull the pain of social rejection.
</li><li>Still, if Hume is right, this prefrontal activity shouldn’t be framed as it’s commonly framed, as reason “overcoming temptation” or successfully “opposing feeling.” Reason has its effect not by directly pushing back against a feeling but by fortifying the feeling that does do the pushing back.
</li><li>High school football coaches have a way of describing this dynamic. They say that self-discipline is like a muscle. If you use it, it gets stronger, and if you don’t, it gets weaker. This truism does seem to capture the broad pattern; if the part of you that’s arguing against indulgence prevails a few times—if it gets successfully “exercised”—its chances of success will be better next time, whereas if it loses a few times in a row, it will be headed toward a very long losing streak.
</li><li>There’s an acronym used to describe this technique: RAIN. First you Recognize the feeling. Then you Accept the feeling (rather than try to drive it away). Then you Investigate the feeling and its relationship to your body. Finally, the N stands for Nonidentification, or, equivalently, Nonattachment.
</li><li>“The sound is just the sound. It’s me who is going out to annoy it. If I leave the sound alone, it won’t annoy me. . . . If I don’t go out and bother the sound, it’s not going to bother me.”
</li><li>You see, all the states of equanimity come through the realization that things aren’t what we thought they were.”
</li><li>“There’s no such thing as a simple pleasure. There’s no such thing as a pleasure that’s untainted by your beliefs about what you’re being pleasured by.”
</li><li>The more I thought about it, the more that lizard and I seemed to have in common. We were both thrown into a world we didn’t choose, under the guidance of behavioral algorithms we didn’t choose, and were trying to make the best of the situation. I felt a kind of kinship with the lizard that I’d never felt with a lizard.
</li><li>The obvious rejoinder is “But the tingling originates inside your skin; it’s part of you!” Well, yes, it’s inside my skin. But the whole question I’m raising is whether my skin is really as significant a boundary as we instinctively assume—whether it really makes sense to think of everything on the inside as me and everything on the outside as other.
</li><li>The great American psychologist William James wrote, “Between what a man calls me and what he simply calls mine the line is difficult to draw.”
</li><li>“If you are nothing, instead of just disappearing and becoming a void, you find out that in some strange way—you actually see this, you
</li><li>Anyway, my basic view of religious beliefs is that the ultimate question isn’t their specific content, but rather: What kind of person do the beliefs make you? How do they lead you to behave?
</li><li>After all, natural selection, like the robot overlords, engineered the delusions that control us; it built them into our brains. If you’re willing to personify natural selection, you can carry the comparison with robot overlords a bit further: natural selection perpetrated the delusion in order to get us to adhere slavishly to its agenda.
</li><li>Henry Sidgwick when he alluded to “the self-evident principle that the good of any one individual is of no more importance, from the point of view (if I may say so) of the Universe, than the good of any other.”
</li><li>5. The two basic feelings that sponsor dukkha—the two sides of tanha, a clinging attraction to things and an aversion to things—needn’t enslave us as they tend to do. Meditative disciplines such as mindfulness meditation can weaken the grip they exert.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Sunday, September 3, 2023 3:38:29 PM
</h4><ul><li>The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.
</li><li>I shall argue that the primary reason it is so difficult to achieve happiness centers on the fact that, contrary to the myths mankind has developed to reassure itself, the universe was not created to answer our needs. Frustration is deeply woven into the fabric of life.
</li><li>“The universe is not hostile, nor yet is it friendly,” in the words of J. H. Holmes. “It is simply indifferent.”
</li><li>Whether we are happy depends on inner harmony, not on the controls we are able to exert over the great forces of the universe. Certainly we should keep on learning how to master the external environment, because our physical survival may depend on it. But such mastery is not going to add one jot to how good we as individuals feel, or reduce the chaos of the world as we experience it.
</li><li>When people start believing that progress is inevitable and life easy, they may quickly lose courage and determination in the face of the first signs of adversity. As they realize that what they had believed in is not entirely true, they abandon faith in everything else they have learned. Deprived of the customary supports that cultural values had given them, they flounder in a morass of anxiety and apathy.
</li><li>We grow up believing that what counts most in our lives is that which will occur in the future. Parents teach children that if they learn good habits now, they will be better off as adults. Teachers assure pupils that the boring classes will benefit them later, when the students are going to be looking for jobs. The company vice president tells junior employees to have patience and work hard, because one of these days they will be promoted to the executive ranks. At the end of the long struggle for advancement, the golden years of retirement beckon. “We are always getting to live,” as Ralph Waldo Emerson used to say, “but never living.” Or as poor Frances learned in the children’s story, it is always bread and jam tomorrow, never bread and jam today.
</li><li>To lure recruits into the Turkish armed forces, the sultans of the sixteenth century promised conscripts the rewards of raping women in the conquered territories;
</li><li>It is important to realize that seeking pleasure is a reflex response built into our genes for the preservation of the species, not for the purpose of our own personal advantage.
</li><li>In dreams we are locked into a single scenario we cannot change at will. The events that constitute consciousness—the “things” we see, feel, think, and desire—are information that we can manipulate and use. Thus we might think of consciousness as intentionally ordered information.
</li><li>Ed Diener, a researcher from the University of Illinois, found that very wealthy persons report being happy on the average 77 percent of the time, while persons of average wealth say they are happy only 62 percent of the time.
</li><li>In a comprehensive survey entitled The Quality of American Life published a decade ago, the authors report that a person’s financial situation is one of the least important factors affecting overall satisfaction with life.
</li><li>As our studies have suggested, the phenomenology of enjoyment has eight major components. When people reflect on how it feels when their experience is most positive, they mention at least one, and often all, of the following. First, the experience usually occurs when we confront tasks we have a chance of completing. Second, we must be able to concentrate on what we are doing. Third and fourth, the concentration is usually possible because the task undertaken has clear goals and provides immediate feedback. Fifth, one acts with a deep but effortless involvement that removes from awareness the worries and frustrations of everyday life. Sixth, enjoyable experiences allow people to exercise a sense of control over their actions. Seventh, concern for the self disappears, yet paradoxically the sense of self emerges stronger after the flow experience is over. Finally, the sense of the duration of time is altered; hours pass by in minutes, and minutes can stretch out to seem like hours. The combination of all these elements causes a sense of deep enjoyment that is so rewarding people feel that expending a great deal of energy is worthwhile simply to be able to feel it.
</li><li>Competition is enjoyable only when it is a means to perfect one’s skills; when it becomes an end in itself, it ceases to be fun.
</li><li>Enjoyment appears at the boundary between boredom and anxiety, when the challenges are just balanced with the person’s capacity to act.
</li><li>“The mystique of rock climbing is climbing; you get to the top of a rock glad it’s over but really wish it would go on forever. The justification of climbing is climbing, like the justification of poetry is writing; you don’t conquer anything except things in yourself…. The act of writing justifies poetry. Climbing is the same: recognizing that you are a flow. The purpose of the flow is to keep on flowing, not looking for a peak or utopia but staying in the flow. It is not a moving up but a continuous flowing; you move up to keep the flow going. There is no possible reason for climbing except the climbing itself; it is a self-communication.”
</li><li>It is an illusion to believe that any solution is beneficial for all people and all times; no human achievement can be taken as the final word.
</li><li>Humans began decorating caves at least thirty thousand years ago. These paintings surely had religious and practical significance. However, it is likely that the major raison d’être of art was the same in the Paleolithic era as it is now—namely, it was a source of flow for the painter and for the viewer.
</li><li>We have come to accept that our morality simply no longer has currency outside our own culture.
</li><li>Cultures are defensive constructions against chaos, designed to reduce the impact of randomness on experience. They are adaptive responses, just as feathers are for birds and fur is for mammals.
</li><li>When the now extinct natives of the Caribbean islands were put to work in the plantations of the conquering Spaniards, their lives became so painful and meaningless that they lost interest in survival, and eventually ceased reproducing.
</li><li>Richard Logan, who has studied the accounts of many people in difficult situations, concludes that they survived by finding ways to turn the bleak objective conditions into subjectively controllable experience.
</li><li>Narcissistic individuals, who are mainly concerned with protecting their self, fall apart when the external conditions turn threatening. The ensuing panic prevents them from doing what they must do; their attention turns inward in an effort to restore order in consciousness, and not enough remains to negotiate outside reality.
</li><li>Bertrand Russell, one of the greatest philosophers of our century, described how he achieved personal happiness: “Gradually I learned to be indifferent to myself and my deficiencies; I came to center my attention increasingly upon external objects: the state of the world, various branches of knowledge, individuals for whom I felt affection.” There could be no better short description of how to build for oneself an autotelic personality.
</li><li>What we found was that when people were pursuing leisure activities that were expensive in terms of the outside resources required—activities that demanded expensive equipment, or electricity, or other forms of energy measured in BTUs, such as power boating, driving, or watching television—they were significantly less happy than when involved in inexpensive leisure. People were happiest when they were just talking to one another, when they gardened, knitted, or were involved in a hobby; all of these activities require few material resources, but they demand a relatively high investment of psychic energy. Leisure that uses up external resources, however, often requires less attention, and as a consequence it generally provides less memorable rewards.
</li><li>Sometimes having control over such an internalized symbol system can save one’s life. It has been claimed, for instance, that the reason there are more poets per capita in Iceland than in any other country of the world is that reciting the sagas became a way for the Icelanders to keep their consciousness ordered in an environment exceedingly hostile to human existence.
</li><li>Stress exists only if we experience it; it takes the most extreme objective conditions to cause it directly.
</li><li>Ironically, jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback, rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one’s work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed.
</li><li>STUDIES ON FLOW have demonstrated repeatedly that more than anything else, the quality of life depends on two factors: how we experience work, and our relations with other people.
</li><li>The Latin locution for “being alive” was inter hominem esse, which literally meant “to be among men”; whereas “to be dead” was inter hominem esse desinere, or “to cease to be among men.”
</li><li>which in Greek originally meant a “private person”—someone who is unable to learn from others.
</li><li>Why is solitude such a negative experience? The bottom-line answer is that keeping order in the mind from within is very difficult. We need external goals, external stimulation, external feedback to keep attention directed. And when external input is lacking, attention begins to wander, and thoughts become chaotic—resulting in the state we have called “psychic entropy” in chapter 2.
</li><li>If a person does not know how to control attention in solitude, he will inevitably turn to the easy external solutions: drugs, entertainment, excitement—whatever dulls or distracts the mind.
</li><li>Cicero once wrote that to be completely free one must become a slave to a set of laws. In other words, accepting limitations is liberating. For example, by making up one’s mind to invest psychic energy exclusively in a monogamous marriage, regardless of any problems, obstacles, or more attractive options that may come along later, one is freed of the constant pressure of trying to maximize emotional returns.
</li><li>Unconditional acceptance is especially important to children. If parents threaten to withdraw their love from a child when he fails to measure up, the child’s natural playfulness will be gradually replaced by chronic anxiety.
</li><li>Subjective experience is not just one of the dimensions of life, it is life itself. Material conditions are secondary: they only affect us indirectly, by way of experience. Flow, and even pleasure, on the other hand, benefit the quality of life directly. Health, money, and other material advantages may or may not improve life. Unless a person has learned to control psychic energy, chances are such advantages will be useless.
</li><li>happening are extremely slim. The likelihood that our desires
</li><li>The likelihood that our desires will be always fulfilled is so minute as to be negligible.
</li><li>Why are some people weakened by stress, while others gain strength from it? Basically the answer is simple: those who know how to transform a hopeless situation into a new flow activity that can be controlled will be able to enjoy themselves, and emerge stronger from the ordeal.
</li><li>To experience psychic entropy one must concentrate on the internal disorder; but by paying attention to what is happening around oneself instead, the destructive effects of stress are lessened.
</li><li>Living exclusively by genetic and social instructions is fine as long as everything goes well. But the moment biological or social goals are frustrated—which in the long run is inevitable—a person must formulate new goals, and create a new flow activity for himself, or else he will waste his energies in inner turmoil.
</li><li>It is true that life has no meaning, if by that we mean a supreme goal built into the fabric of nature and human experience, a goal that is valid for every individual. But it does not follow that life cannot be given meaning. Much of what we call culture and civilization consists in efforts people have made, generally against overwhelming odds, to create a sense of purpose for themselves and their descendants. It is one thing to recognize that life is, by itself, meaningless. It is another thing entirely to accept this with resignation. The first fact does not entail the second any more than the fact that we lack wings prevents us from flying.
</li><li>The original condition of human beings, prior to the development of self-reflective consciousness, must have been a state of inner peace disturbed only now and again by tides of hunger, sexuality, pain, and danger. The forms of psychic entropy that currently cause us so much anguish—unfulfilled wants, dashed expectations, loneliness, frustration, anxiety, guilt—are all likely to have been recent invaders of the mind. They are by-products of the tremendous increase in complexity of the cerebral cortex and of the symbolic enrichment of culture. They are the dark side of the emergence of consciousness.
</li><li>To discard the hard-won information on how to live accumulated by our ancestors, or to expect to discover a viable set of goals all by oneself, is misguided hubris. The chances of success are about as good as in trying to build an electron microscope without the tools and knowledge of physics.
</li><li>The most promising faith for the future might be based on the realization that the entire universe is a system related by common laws and that it makes no sense to impose our dreams and desires on nature without taking them into account.

</li><li>If an atom is 99.99999 percent energy and .00001 percent physical substance,1 then I’m actually more nothing than something! So why do I keep my attention on that small percentage of the physical world when I am so much more? Is defining my present reality by what I perceive with my senses the biggest limitation I have?
</li><li>Your past shortfalls can be traced, at their root, to one major oversight: you haven’t committed yourself to living by the truth that your thoughts have consequences so great that they create your reality.
</li><li>What quantum physicists discovered was that the person observing (or measuring) the tiny particles that make up atoms affects the behavior of energy and matter. Quantum experiments demonstrated that electrons exist simultaneously in an infinite array of possibilities or probabilities in an invisible field of energy. But only when an observer focuses attention on any location of any one electron does that electron appear. In other words, a particle cannot manifest in reality—that is, ordinary space-time as we know it—until we observe it.1
</li><li>When you think from your past memories, you can only create past experiences.
</li><li>The more you fire the same circuits by reacting to your external life, the more you’ll wire your brain to be equal to your personal world. You’ll become neurochemically attached to the conditions in your life.
</li><li>The brain constantly monitors the way the body is feeling. Based on the chemical feedback it receives, it will generate more thoughts that produce chemicals corresponding to the way the body is feeling, so that we first begin to feel the way we think and then to think the way we feel.
</li><li>Have you known people who always seem to talk about “the good old days”? What they’re really saying is: Nothing new is happening in my life to stimulate my feelings; therefore I’ll have to reaffirm myself from some glorious moments in the past.
</li><li>We now know that less than 5 percent of all diseases today stem from single-gene disorders (such as Tay-Sachs and Huntington’s chorea), whereas around 95 percent of all illnesses are related to lifestyle choices, chronic stress, and toxic factors in the environment.
</li><li>If you start keeping track of your thoughts and write them down, you’ll find that most of the time, you are either thinking ahead or looking back.
</li><li>This kind of repetitive stress is harmful to us, because no organism was designed with a mechanism to deal with negative effects on the body when the stress response is turned on with great frequency and for long duration. In other words, no creature can avoid the consequences of living in long-term emergency situations. When we turn on the stress response and can’t turn it
</li><li>“Nerve cells that fire together, wire together.”
</li><li>My definition of mastery is that our internal chemical state is greater than anything in our external world. You are a master when you’ve conditioned yourself with chosen thoughts and feelings, you’ve memorized desired emotional/chemical states, and nothing in your external life deters you from your aims. No person, no thing, and no experience at any time or place should disrupt your internal chemical coherence. You can think, act, and feel differently whenever you choose.
</li><li>You could have been the most successful, popular, or beautiful person, and you could have had all the wealth you ever needed … but when your life ends and your external reality is taken away, everything outside of you can no longer define you. It all goes.
</li><li>If the soul’s purpose is to learn from experience and gain wisdom, but you stayed stuck in that particular emotion, you never turned your experience into a lesson; you didn’t transcend that emotion and exchange it for any understanding.
</li><li>The truth is, the problems you’re so busy analyzing can’t be resolved within the emotion you are analyzing them in. Why not? Well, your analysis is creating higher and higher frequencies of Beta. Thinking in this mode causes your brain to overreact; you reason poorly and think without clarity.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Tuesday, September 12, 2023 10:41:04 PM
</h4><ul><li>That the West has little to learn from present-day India, I shall not trouble to deny, but that we have much to learn from Indian sages of the past and from the few who live to-day, I unhesitatingly assert.
</li><li>If our ideas about life are to be wholly determined by a mere accident of space, by the chance that we were born in Bristol instead of Bombay, then we are not worthy the name of civilized man.
</li><li>“The prophets lay down certain rules and regulations to help the masses lead better lives and to incline them towards God. Gradually these rules become the tenets of an organized religion, but the idealistic spirit and motive force which prevail during the founder’s lifetime, disappear gradually after his death. That is why organizations cannot bring spiritual truth nearer and why true religion is always a personal concern. Religious organizations become like archæological departments trying to resuscitate the past.
</li><li>It is not always easy to read the pages of the soul by the letters of the body.
</li><li>‘To succeed on the path of Yoga, one must have a personal teacher.’
</li><li>“Animals know how to rest themselves, but not many men have this knowledge. This is because animals are guided by instinct, which is the voice of Nature, while men are guided by their thoughts. And since men largely lack control over their brains, their nerves and bodies are affected as a result; there is little real repose for them.”
</li><li>Our way of sitting is really most restful. After working or walking, it gives peace to the entire body. The easiest way for you to learn it is to place a small rug or mat before the wall of your room; sit upon this as comfortably as you can and use the wall to support your back. Or you can place the mat in the centre of the room, and then use a couch or chair to lean against. After that, bend the legs inwards at the knees and cross the feet. There need be no feeling of strain and you must not tighten the muscles. So your first exercise will be to sit like that and keep your body quite still, except for the effort of gentle breathing. And having got into that position, you must promise yourself that you will withdraw your thoughts from all worldly burdens and affairs; just rest your mind on a beautiful object, a picture or a flower.”
</li><li>“Have you not heard the story of the faqueer who was buried by Ranjeet Singh in a vault at Lahore? The burial of the faqueer took place in the presence of English army officers, while the last of the Sikh kings watched it himself. The living tomb was guarded by soldiers for six weeks, but the faqueer emerged healthy and alive. Enquire into this story, for I have been told that it is written somewhere in the records of your Government. This faqueer had brought his breathing under great mastery and could stop it at will without danger of dying. Yet he was not even an adept in Yoga, for I have heard from an old man who knew him when he was alive that his character was not good. His name was Haridas and he lived in the North. If this man could live in an airless space for such a long time without breathing, how much more can be done by the true masters of Yoga, who practise in secret and will not perform these marvels for gold?”
</li><li>“Without a master, your books are mere pieces of paper. Our word for him, guru, means: ‘One who dispels darkness.’ The man whose efforts and destiny favour him sufficiently to find a real teacher, steps quickly into a state of light, for the master uses his own higher gifts to benefit the disciple.”
</li><li>I have since verified this reference and find that the actual episode occurred in 1837 at Lahore. The faqueer was buried in the presence of King Ranjit Singh, Sir Claude Wade, Dr. Honigberger, and others. A guard of Sikh soldiers watched the grave day and night to prevent fraud. The faqueer was dug up alive forty days later. Fuller particulars can be found in the archives at Calcutta.
</li><li>His face photographs itself immediately in my memory as the face of a man who smiles in triumph over life, a man who has conquered the frailties which we, feebler mortals that we are, harbour willingly or unwillingly.
</li><li>“This backward-turning of thought is the highest Yoga.
</li><li>“When you know the Truth you will know exactly what to do to serve mankind best, nor will you lack the power to do so. If a flower possesses the honey, the bee will find it out of its own accord. If a man possesses spiritual wisdom and strength, he need not go in search of people; they will come unasked to him. Cultivate your inner self until you know it fully. No other instruction is necessary. This is the only thing to do.”
</li><li>He does not make an art of conversation for its own sake, as we do in the West.
</li><li>“Do not blame people so much as the environments into which they are born. Their surroundings and circumstances force them to become worse than they really are. That is true of both the East and West.
</li><li>He is a pontiff who cares not for worldly power, because he has renounced all and resigned all. Whatever material things are given to him, he at once gives again to those who need them.
</li><li>They do not appear to know what it means to go through dark nights of the soul, when the world seems like the grim scene of a jungle-like struggle; when God recedes into shadowy nothingness; and when man’s own existence seems nothing more than a fitful passage across this small, transient fragment of the universe which we call Earth.
</li><li>“There is only one thing to be done. Look into your own self. Do this in the right way and you shall find the answer to all your problems.”
</li><li>“Why should you trouble yourself about the future?” demands the sage. “You do not even properly know about the present! Take care of the present; the future will then take care of itself.”
</li><li>“The life of action need not be renounced. If you will meditate for an hour or two every day, you can then carry on with your duties. If you meditate in the right manner, then the current of mind induced will continue to flow even in the midst of your work. It is as though there were two ways of expressing the same idea; the same line which you take in meditation will be expressed in your activities.”
</li><li>“Setting apart time for meditation is only for the merest spiritual novices,” he replies. “A man who is advancing will begin to enjoy the deeper beatitude, whether he is at work or not. While his hands are in society, he keeps his head cool in solitude.”
</li><li>“Man’s real nature is happiness. Happiness is inborn in the true self. His search for happiness is an unconscious search for his true self. The true self is imperishable; therefore, when a man finds it, he finds a happiness which does not come to an end.”
</li><li>“The first and foremost of all thoughts, the primeval thought in the mind of every man, is the thought ‘I.’ It is only after the birth of this thought that any other thoughts can arise at all. It is only after the first personal pronoun ‘I’ has arisen in the mind, that the second personal pronoun ‘You’ can make its appearance. If you could mentally follow the ‘I’ thread until it leads you back to its source, you would discover that, just as it is the first thought to appear, so is it the last to disappear. This is a matter which can be experienced.”
</li><li>“Unless and until a man embarks upon this quest of the true self, doubt and uncertainty will follow his footsteps throughout life. The greatest kings and statesmen try to rule others, when in their heart of hearts they know that they cannot rule themselves. Yet the greatest power is at the command of the man who has penetrated to his inmost depth. There are men of giant intellects who spend their lives gathering knowledge about many things. Ask these men if they have solved the mystery of man, if they have conquered themselves, and they will hang their heads in shame. What is the use of knowing about everything else when you do not yet know who you are? Men avoid this enquiry into the true self, but what else is there so worthy to be undertaken?”
</li><li>The average man in the West has no time for such a quest. He possesses a good excuse for accepting the prevailing mood of indifference, because he knows that if he errs, then he errs in company with a whole continent. For this sceptical age treats the search after truth as a trifle, while spending its own energy upon the serious pursuit of what our best moments reveal as trifles. Somehow it never occurs to us that the few whose lives are spent in the passionate quest of life’s real meaning, are more likely to form correct opinions on the problems of the passing hour, than those who spend their energies upon a dozen different interests and have given barely a single thought to the discovery of truth.
</li><li>Nevertheless, such was my determination not to be of the world although I was in it, that on some nights I would retire at dead of night to the open veranda before the Senate House and sleep among the homeless beggars of the city, who usually collected there to spend the night. This used to make me feel, temporarily at least, that I was a man with no possessions.
</li><li>Benares is reputed to be the oldest populated town in India.
</li><li>I become ready for the strangest experiences that this planet, which hurries so swiftly through the abysses of space, can bring me.
</li><li>What is the meaning of this mystery of chance, which, by the mere fortune of birth, puts one man in dirt-stained rags upon this road and another in silken robes in yonder riverside palace? Life is truly a dark enigma; I cannot comprehend it.
</li><li>The trouble is that for the first fifty years or so a religion is pure and vital. Later it degenerates into a mere philosophy; its followers become talkers—not religiously-living men. Finally it descends, for its last and longest phase, into the arms of hypocritical priests. In the end, hypocrisy becomes accepted as religion.”
</li><li>I find also that Meher Baba is a fallible authority, a man subject to constantly changing moods, and an egotist who demands complete enslavement on the part of his brain-stupefied followers.
</li><li>“The past is but a heap of ashes,” he answers. “Do not ask me to poke my finger in the ashes and pick out dead experiences. I live neither in the past nor the future. In the depths of the human spirit, these things are no more real than shadows. That also is the wisdom I have learnt.”
</li><li>“Life itself is nothing more than a cinema play unrolling its episodes from the cradle to the grave. Where now are the past scenes—can you hold them? Where are those yet to come—can you grasp them? Instead of trying to find the Real, the Enduring, the Eternal, you come here and waste time on what is even more deceptive than ordinary existence—a wholly imaginary story, an illusion within the great illusion.”
</li><li>“That is the surest way to handicap oneself,” he answers unmoved, “this burdening of one’s mind with the fear of failure and the thought of one’s failings.” “Yet if it is true——?” I persist. “It is not true. The greatest error of a man is to think that he is weak by nature, evil by nature. Every man is divine and strong in his real nature. What are weak and evil are his habits, his desires and thoughts, but not himself.”
</li><li>“When the goal is reached, when you know the Knower, there is no difference between living in a house in London and living in the solitude of a jungle,”
</li><li>“Pursue the enquiry ‘Who am I?’ relentlessly. Analyse your entire personality. Try to find out where the I-thought begins. Go on with your meditations. Keep turning your attention within. One day the wheel of thought will slow down and an intuition will mysteriously arise. Follow that intuition, let your thinking stop, and it will eventually lead you to the goal.”
</li><li>Whoever can recall rare moments when beauty made him a dweller amid the eternities should, whenever the world tires him, turn memory into a spur and seek out the sanctuary within. Thither he should wander for a little peace, a flush of strength and a glimmer of light, confident that the moment he succeeds in touching his true selfhood he will draw infinite support and find perfect compensation.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Friday, September 15, 2023 12:25:26 PM
</h4><ul><li>The brain is one of the most beautiful things I have ever seen, and to explore its mysteries and find ways to heal it is a privilege I have never taken for granted.
</li><li>“I think the magic trick works because people see only what they think is there rather than what’s actually there. This thumb tip trick works because the mind is a funny thing. It sees what it expects to see. It expects to see a real thumb, so that’s what it sees. The brain, as busy as it can be, is actually very lazy. And yes, it also works because people are, as you said, so easily distracted. But they’re not distracted by hand gestures. Most people who are watching a magic show aren’t really there watching the magic show. They are regretting something they did yesterday or worrying about something that might happen tomorrow, so they’re not really at the magic show to begin with, so how could they see the plastic thumb at all?”
</li><li>Aristotle believed that the brain functioned primarily as a cooling mechanism for the blood, and this was why humans (with their larger brains) were more rational than the “hot-blooded” beasts.
</li><li>“You know in World War II there were special decks of cards that were made and sent to prisoners of war in Germany? Each card could be peeled apart and hidden inside was a section of a map that, if you pieced it all together, showed a secret escape route for the prisoners. Now that was an amazing magic trick.”
</li><li>Feelings are not right or wrong. They are just feelings.”
</li><li>“There are a lot of things in life we can’t control. It’s hard, especially when you’re a child, to feel like you have control over anything. Like you can change anything. But you can control your body and you can control your mind. That might not sound like a lot, but it’s very powerful. It can change everything.”
</li><li>“Here’s what I want you to understand. You can’t trust the voice in your head—the one that’s talking to you all the time. It’s more often wrong than right. You can think of this trick as learning to turn the volume way down and eventually turning it off altogether. Then you’ll understand what I’m talking about.”
</li><li>As a surgeon I have often heard my patients describe how they experience pain more acutely at night—it’s not that their pain is worse at night, it’s just that there’s no distraction. The mind gets quiet and the pain that was there all day seems louder. It’s the same reason why our eyes can fly open at 2 A.M., and every anxiety about the future or regret about the past will play itself out in the dark of night.
</li><li>I PRACTICED MY MANTRA at home. Sometimes for hours at a time. For reasons that I understand now, it was amazingly calming. Repetition. Intention. The surest way to change your brain.
</li><li>I wish I had learned at twelve to lead with a heart that’s wide-open—to others and to the world.
</li><li>“It is a lot of work, but that’s the trick. You can have anything you want by visualizing that it’s already yours. It’s that simple and that hard, all at the same time.
</li><li>And also remember, Jim, it is your thoughts that create reality. Others can create your reality only if you don’t create it yourself.”
</li><li>The brain doesn’t distinguish between an experience that is intensely imagined and an experience that is real.
</li><li>Another mystery of the brain is that it will always choose what is familiar over what is unfamiliar. By visualizing my own future success, I was making this success familiar to my brain. Intention is a funny thing, and whatever the brain puts its intention on is what it sees.
</li><li>Only later did I realize that many people will help if they are just asked.
</li><li>I was living for the future that existed in my mind, and it was a far more enjoyable place to live than our small dingy apartment that smelled like mold and cigarette smoke.
</li><li>I remembered Ruth once telling me that just because something is broken doesn’t mean everything is broken.
</li><li>I STILL VISUALIZE what I want in life. I see it through a window in my mind that often isn’t quite clear and then I trust with absolute faith that when the time is right, it will be crystal clear. I have learned that this process of manifesting isn’t always linear and doesn’t always operate on a timeline that is as I desire or makes sense, but whatever I visualize usually manifests, and when it doesn’t there clearly has been a good reason it didn’t. Over the decades I have learned that having faith in the outcome is quite different from being attached to the outcome, and I learned the hard way that you have to be careful about what it is exactly that you want to manifest. I have also learned that there is immense power contained in one’s intent.
</li><li>The energy of the universe is within us. It is in that stardust that makes up each of us. All that power of creation. All that power of expansion. All that beautiful, simple, synchronized power. Energy can flow from one place to another. And it can flow from one person to another.
</li><li>We are born and we die, and everything that happens between the two can feel so random it defies logic. The only choice we have is in how we respond in each precious moment we are given.
</li><li>When the time came to apply to medical school, not only did I have a GPA of 2.5, it looked like I wouldn’t even graduate. As a premed student, I was failing miserably. The average GPA for acceptance to medical school at that time was almost 3.8.
</li><li>I found that several of my fellow students were happy to remind me that with my grades I would never get into medical school. Unfortunately, so many people allow others to decide what they can or cannot do. This was another gift that Ruth gave me—the ability to believe in myself and accept that not everyone will want me to succeed or accomplish great things. And how to be OK with that reality and not react to it.
</li><li>Sometimes rules and criteria are critically important, but oftentimes they are arbitrary and act only to sift through numbers and limit opportunity.
</li><li>A 2013 study by researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara, found that focused-attention meditation training improved memory, focus, and overall cognitive function in undergraduate students after just two weeks of practice, as measured by improved GRE scores and other memory and focus tests.
</li><li>We can die a thousand times in this lifetime, and that is one of the greatest gifts of being alive.
</li><li>The divorce rates among physicians are said to be 20 percent higher than those of the general population, and the rate for the neurosurgery profession is even higher. I was no exception to this rule.
</li><li>IT SEEMED that all of my friends disappeared almost as quickly as the zeros in my bank account. There were no more free drinks, free meals, VIP seating in the best restaurants.
</li><li>“Your heart is a compass, and it is your greatest gift, Jim. If you’re ever lost, you just open it up, and it will always steer you in the right direction.”
</li><li>I thought I wanted money. But the truth was, I had gotten money, but there was never enough money to make me feel like I had enough. It was as if the magic show I had begun so many years ago had now stopped. I had just kept pulling out one trick after another, so the applause never stopped, and the show kept going, and the millions piled up. And I was still just as alone, and scared, and lost as I was the first day I met Ruth. If I were being completely honest, there was a part of me that felt completely free now that the money had disappeared.
</li><li>One of humanity’s most enduring myths is that wealth will bring happiness and money is the solution to any problem.
</li><li>I learned that there’s only one way for wealth to bring happiness—and that’s by giving it away.
</li><li>The mind wants to divide and keep us separate. It will teach us to compare ourselves, to differentiate ourselves, to get what’s ours because there is only so much to go around. The heart, however, wants to connect us and wants to share. It wants to show us that there are no differences and that ultimately we are all the same. The heart has an intelligence of its own, and if we learn from it we will know that we keep what we have only by giving it away. If we want to be happy, we make others happy. If we want love, we have to give love. If we want joy, we need to make others joyful. If we want forgiveness, we have to forgive. If we want peace, we have to create it in the world around us.
</li><li>Everything is beautiful at a distance. After returning to medicine, I could look back at my life in Newport Beach and see the beauty in every mistake, every wrong turn, and every misguided belief about what mattered most.
</li><li>Many people in the United States don’t appreciate that on almost all measures of quality or efficacy of healthcare, their country is in the last quadrant while having the most expensive care of all industrialized (first-world) countries and the least satisfied patients. What is also not appreciated is that every other industrialized country in the world offers universal healthcare to all of its citizens with better outcomes and much lower costs.
</li><li>We have to look at another person and think, “They are just like me. They want what I want—to be happy.” When we look at others and see ourselves, we want to connect and help.
</li><li>But trying to hold on to the good distracts us from being present in the moment just as trying to flee from the bad does. Grasping at that feeling of elation is not realistic, not possible, and only leads to disappointment. All such ups and downs are transient.
</li><li>Many have used the analogy that holding anger or hostility against another you feel has wronged you is like drinking poison and hoping it kills the other person.
</li><li>THE HEART BEATS a hundred thousand times a day, sending two thousand gallons of blood through an intricate system of blood vessels that if stretched end to end would cover sixty thousand miles—more than twice the circumference of the earth.
</li><li>THE STETHOSCOPE was invented because in 1816 a French physician was too embarrassed to put his ear up to a female patient’s chest to listen to her heart and lungs (as was the norm at the time) and instead rolled twenty-four sheets of paper into a cone to create some distance between them.
</li><li>I had made an identity out of my poverty, and as long as I carried that identity with me, no matter how much wealth I accumulated, I would always be living in poverty.
</li><li>Most surgeons play music in the operating room—it can calm and soothe the patient or focus and energize the surgical team. Studies have shown that when music is played to patients before surgery they exhibit less anxiety and require less pain medication and sedation. Like meditation techniques, music reduces heart rate, decreases stress, and lowers blood pressure. This calming effect happens not only for the patient but for the surgeon as well.
</li><li>It’s deadly for a surgeon to connect with a patient’s humanity during surgery. It has to be a technical exercise. You have to objectify the person. If you think of what might happen to this fellow human being, you can’t possibly do the surgery. It’s too close to home.
</li><li>There is a part of our brain called the central or periaqueductal grey matter, and its connections to the orbitofrontal cortex are responsible in great part for nurturing behavior. When we see others in pain or suffering, this part of the brain activates, meaning we are wired to nurture and help others when they are in need. Similarly, when we give to others, it lights up the pleasure and reward centers in the brain, even more so than when someone gives to us. And when we see someone acting kindly or being helpful, this in turn causes us to act more compassionately.
</li><li>It is quite extraordinary to be in the presence of the Dalai Lama. There is this absolute and unconditional love he exudes that feels just like taking a deep breath after holding your breath for a long time. You don’t have to be anyone other than who you are, and you are met with total acceptance. It’s a profound feeling, and there are no words that can adequately explain it.
</li><li>Like the Dalai Lama, my religion is kindness. It is a religion that doesn’t require a god who sits in judgment or lengthy dogmatic texts. It is also a religion that doesn’t allow for anyone to feel superior to another and requires us to accept that we are all equal.
</li><li>We can choose, at any moment, to see the people right in front of us for who they are and who they can be.

</h4><ul><li>Every scientist agrees that a photon of light has no mass, meaning that it doesn’t weigh anything, and that it has no volume, meaning that it doesn’t take up any physical space. A photon of light also has a unique relationship to time. So, a photon is there, but it’s not there – not in the way that everything else with mass and volume are there.
</li><li>For my purpose, religion is what we believe and accept to be true, and the spiritual is what we experience as true.
</li><li>In these pages I make statements about spiritual matters from time to time as if they’re facts, but it’s just my way of expressing myself. It’s all opinion, and I don’t ask or expect anyone to agree.
</li><li>The tallest wall between where we are now, and any evolved understanding of our Selves, is our pride.
</li><li>Be like a kid when you stand before the Divine, he said. Don’t be clever. Don’t be mature. How can your maturity or cleverness impress your own Mother, let alone the Divine? Your innocence is all that can connect you.
</li><li>It was a moment of pride, a Me-Me-Me moment that intruded on my devotional Giving to something beyond my Self. Over time I’ve learned to smile when it happens, and then push vanity and pride back into the margins of devotional attention where they belong, until they’re required again in the material world.
</li><li>For my purpose, the difference between the Self and the Ego is this: the Self is what admonishes or laughs at the antics of the Ego.
</li><li>Every enhancement of the authentic Self diminishes the Ego, and every enhancement of the Ego diminishes the authentic Self.

</h4><ul><li>All cats, for example, from the smallest house kitten to the most ferocious lion, share a common feline ancestor who lived about 25 million years ago.
</li><li>Just 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees, the other is our own grandmother.
</li><li>Humans first evolved in East Africa about 2.5 million years ago from an earlier genus of apes called Australopithecus, which means ‘Southern Ape’.
</li><li>It is doubtful whether Homo sapiens will still be around a thousand years from now, so 2 million years is really out of our league.
</li><li>The earth of a hundred millennia ago was walked by at least six different species of man. It’s our current exclusivity, not that multi-species past, that is peculiar – and perhaps incriminating.
</li><li>In Homo sapiens, the brain accounts for about 2–3 per cent of total body weight, but it consumes 25 per cent of the body’s energy when the body is at rest. By comparison, the brains of other apes require only 8 per cent of rest-time energy.
</li><li>The first evidence for tool production dates from about 2.5 million years ago, and the manufacture and use of tools are the criteria by which archaeologists recognise ancient humans.
</li><li>One of the most common uses of early stone tools was to crack open bones in order to get to the marrow.
</li><li>Other animals at the top of the pyramid, such as lions and sharks, evolved into that position very gradually, over millions of years. This enabled the ecosystem to develop checks and balances that prevent lions and sharks from wreaking too much havoc. As lions became deadlier, so gazelles evolved to run faster, hyenas to cooperate better, and rhinoceroses to be more bad-tempered. In contrast, humankind ascended to the top so quickly that the ecosystem was not given time to adjust.
</li><li>Since long intestines and large brains are both massive energy consumers, it’s hard to have both. By shortening the intestines and decreasing their energy consumption, cooking inadvertently opened the way to the jumbo brains of Neanderthals and Sapiens.
</li><li>It turned out that 1–4 per cent of the unique human DNA of modern populations in the Middle East and Europe is Neanderthal DNA. That’s not a huge amount, but it’s significant.
</li><li>Tolerance is not a Sapiens trademark. In modern times, a small difference in skin colour, dialect or religion has been enough to prompt one group of Sapiens to set about exterminating another group. Would ancient Sapiens have been more tolerant towards an entirely different human species?
</li><li>The appearance of new ways of thinking and communicating, between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago, constitutes the Cognitive Revolution. What caused it? We’re not sure. The most commonly believed theory argues that accidental genetic mutations changed the inner wiring of the brains of Sapiens, enabling them to think in unprecedented ways and to communicate using an altogether new type of language.
</li><li>Sociological research has shown that the maximum ‘natural’ size of a group bonded by gossip is about 150 individuals. Most people can neither intimately know, nor gossip effectively about, more than 150 human beings.
</li><li>Green monkeys and chimpanzees can lie. A green monkey, for example, has been observed calling ‘Careful! A lion!’ when there was no lion around. This alarm conveniently frightened away a fellow monkey who had just found a banana, leaving the liar all alone to steal the prize for itself.
</li><li>If a Stone Age woman came across a tree groaning with figs, the most sensible thing to do was to eat as many of them as she could on the spot, before the local baboon band picked the tree bare. The instinct to gorge on high-calorie food was hard-wired into our genes.
</li><li>The common impression that pre-agricultural humans lived in an age of stone is a misconception based on this archaeological bias. The Stone Age should more accurately be called the Wood Age, because most of the tools used by ancient hunter-gatherers were made of wood.
</li><li>The heated debates about Homo sapiens’ ‘natural way of life’ miss the main point. Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, there hasn’t been a single natural way of life for Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from among a bewildering palette of possibilities.
</li><li>The dog was the first animal domesticated by Homo sapiens, and this occurred before the Agricultural Revolution. Experts disagree about the exact date, but we have incontrovertible evidence of domesticated dogs from about 15,000 years ago.
</li><li>Before the Agricultural Revolution, the human population of the entire planet was smaller than that of today’s Cairo.
</li><li>There is some evidence that the size of the average Sapiens brain has actually decreased since the age of foraging.
</li><li>Ancient foragers also suffered less from infectious diseases. Most of the infectious diseases that have plagued agricultural and industrial societies (such as smallpox, measles and tuberculosis) originated in domesticated animals and were transferred to humans only after the Agricultural Revolution. Ancient foragers, who had domesticated only dogs, were free of these scourges.
</li><li>Animism (from ‘anima’, ‘soul’ or ‘spirit’ in Latin) is the belief that almost every place, every animal, every plant and every natural phenomenon has awareness and feelings, and can communicate directly with humans.
</li><li>During the twentieth century, only 5 per cent of human deaths resulted from human violence – and this in a century that saw the bloodiest wars and most massive genocides in history.
</li><li>The journey of the first humans to Australia is one of the most important events in history, at least as important as Columbus’ journey to America or the Apollo II expedition to the moon. It was the first time any human had managed to leave the Afro-Asian ecological system – indeed, the first time any large terrestrial mammal had managed to cross from Afro-Asia to Australia.
</li><li>It’s common today to explain anything and everything as the result of climate change, but the truth is that earth’s climate never rests. It is in constant flux. Every event in history occurred against the background of some climate change.
</li><li>The Maoris, New Zealand’s first Sapiens colonisers, reached the islands about 800 years ago. Within a couple of centuries, the majority of the local megafauna was extinct, along with 60 per cent of all bird species.
</li><li>Homo sapiens was the first and only human species to reach the western hemisphere landmass, arriving about 16,000 years ago, that is in or around 14,000 BC. The first Americans arrived on foot, which they could do because, at the time, sea levels were low enough that a land bridge connected north-eastern Siberia with north-western Alaska.
</li><li>At the time of the Cognitive Revolution, the planet was home to about 200 genera of large terrestrial mammals weighing over 100 pounds. At the time of the Agricultural Revolution, only about a hundred remained. Homo sapiens drove to extinction about half of the planet’s big beasts long before humans invented the wheel, writing, or iron tools.
</li><li>The Agricultural Revolution certainly enlarged the sum total of food at the disposal of humankind, but the extra food did not translate into a better diet or more leisure. Rather, it translated into population explosions and pampered elites. The average farmer worked harder than the average forager, and got a worse diet in return. The Agricultural Revolution was history’s biggest fraud.
</li><li>Humans, like many mammals, have hormonal and genetic mechanisms that help control procreation. In good times females reach puberty earlier, and their chances of getting pregnant are a bit higher. In bad times puberty is late and fertility decreases.
</li><li>In most agricultural societies at least one out of every three children died before reaching twenty.5 Yet the increase in births still outpaced the increase in deaths; humans kept having larger numbers of children.
</li><li>One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and to spawn new obligations. Once people get used to a certain luxury, they take it for granted. Then they begin to count on it. Finally they reach a point where they can’t live without it.
</li><li>Following Homo sapiens, domesticated cattle, pigs and sheep are the second, third and fourth most widespread large mammals in the world.
</li><li>To ensure that the pigs can’t run away, farmers in northern New Guinea slice off a chunk of each pig’s nose. This causes severe pain whenever the pig tries to sniff. Since the pigs cannot find food or even find their way around without sniffing, this mutilation makes them completely dependent on their human owners. In another area of New Guinea, it has been customary to gouge out pigs’ eyes, so that they cannot even see where they’re going.
</li><li>Around 10,000 BC, before the transition to agriculture, earth was home to about 5–8 million nomadic foragers. By the first century AD, only 1–2 million foragers remained (mainly in Australia, America and Africa), but their numbers were dwarfed by the world’s 250 million farmers.
</li><li>The earth’s surface measures about 200 million square miles, of which 60 million is land. As late as AD 1400, the vast majority of farmers, along with their plants and animals, clustered together in an area of just 4.25 million square miles – 2 per cent of the planet’s surface.2 Everywhere else was too cold, too hot, too dry, too wet, or otherwise unsuited for cultivation. This minuscule 2 per cent of the earth’s surface constituted the stage on which history unfolded.
</li><li>Until the late modern era, more than 90 percent of humans were peasants who rose each morning to till the land by the sweat of their brows. The extra they produced fed the tiny minority of elites – kings, government officials, soldiers, priests, artists and thinkers – who fill the history books. History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets.
</li><li>The problem at the root of such calamities is that humans evolved for millions of years in small bands of a few dozen individuals. The handful of millennia separating the Agricultural Revolution from the appearance of cities, kingdoms and empires was not enough time to allow an instinct for mass cooperation to evolve.
</li><li>This is exactly what I mean by ‘imagined order’. We believe in a particular order not because it is objectively true, but because believing in it enables us to cooperate effectively and forge a better society. Imagined orders are not evil conspiracies or useless mirages. Rather, they are the only way large numbers of humans can cooperate effectively.
</li><li>Voltaire said about God that ‘there is no God, but don’t tell that to my servant, lest he murder me at night’.
</li><li>‘You can do many things with bayonets, but it is rather uncomfortable to sit on them.’
</li><li>Most people do not wish to accept that the order governing their lives is imaginary, but in fact every person is born into a pre-existing imagined order, and his or her desires are shaped from birth by its dominant myths. Our personal desires thereby become the imagined order’s most important defences.
</li><li>The most important impact of script on human history is precisely this: it has gradually changed the way humans think and view the world. Free association and holistic thought have given way to compartmentalisation and bureaucracy.
</li><li>Yet it’s a proven fact that most rich people are rich for the simple reason that they were born into a rich family, while most poor people will remain poor throughout their lives simply because they were born into a poor family.
</li><li>If you want to keep any human group isolated – women, Jews, Roma, gays, blacks – the best way to do it is convince everyone that these people are a source of pollution.
</li><li>Clennon King, a black student who applied to the University of Mississippi in 1958, was forcefully committed to a mental asylum. The presiding judge ruled that a black person must surely be insane to think that he could be admitted to the University of Mississippi.
</li><li>Unjust discrimination often gets worse, not better, with time. Money comes to money, and poverty to poverty. Education comes to education, and ignorance to ignorance. Those once victimised by history are likely to be victimised yet again. And those whom history has privileged are more likely to be privileged again.
</li><li>As of 2006, there were still fifty-three countries where a husband could not be prosecuted for the rape of his wife. Even in Germany, rape laws were amended only in 1997 to create a legal category of marital rape.
</li><li>How can we distinguish what is biologically determined from what people merely try to justify through biological myths? A good rule of thumb is ‘Biology enables, Culture forbids.’
</li><li>Organs have not evolved with a purpose, and the way they are used is in constant flux. There is not a single organ in the human body that only does the job its prototype did when it first appeared hundreds of millions of years ago. Organs evolve to perform a particular function, but once they exist, they can be adapted for other usages as well. Mouths, for example, appeared because the earliest multicellular organisms needed a way to take nutrients into their bodies. We still use our mouths for that purpose, but we also use them to kiss, speak and, if we are Rambo, to pull the pins out of hand grenades.
</li><li>Money is accordingly a system of mutual trust, and not just any system of mutual trust: money is the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised.
</li><li>For thousands of years, philosophers, thinkers and prophets have besmirched money and called it the root of all evil. Be that as it may, money is also the apogee of human tolerance. Money is more open-minded than language, state laws, cultural codes, religious beliefs and social habits. Money is the only trust system created by humans that can bridge almost any cultural gap, and that does not discriminate on the basis of religion, gender, race, age or sexual orientation. Thanks to money, even people who don’t know each other and don’t trust each other can nevertheless cooperate effectively.
</li><li>A significant proportion of humanity’s cultural achievements owe their existence to the exploitation of conquered populations. The profits and prosperity brought by Roman imperialism provided Cicero, Seneca and St Augustine with the leisure and wherewithal to think and write; the Taj Mahal could not have been built without the wealth accumulated by Mughal exploitation of their Indian subjects; and the Habsburg Empire’s profits from its rule over its Slavic, Hungarian and Romanian-speaking provinces paid Haydn’s salaries and Mozart’s commissions.
</li><li>Commercial tea farming did not exist in India until the mid-nineteenth century, when it was introduced by the British East India Company. It was the snobbish British sahibs who spread the custom of tea drinking throughout the subcontinent.
</li><li>Still, if we combine all the victims of all these persecutions, it turns out that in these three centuries, the polytheistic Romans killed no more than a few thousand Christians.1 In contrast, over the course of the next 1,500 years, Christians slaughtered Christians by the millions to defend slightly different interpretations of the religion of love and compassion.
</li><li>In this attack, the St Bartholomew’s Day Massacre, between 5,000 and 10,000 Protestants were slaughtered in less than twenty-four hours.
</li><li>With time some followers of polytheist gods became so fond of their particular patron that they drifted away from the basic polytheist insight. They began to believe that their god was the only god, and that He was in fact the supreme power of the universe.
</li><li>At the beginning of the first century AD, there were hardly any monotheists in the world.
</li><li>Belief in heaven (the realm of the good god) and hell (the realm of the evil god) was also dualist in origin. There is no trace of this belief in the Old Testament, which also never claims that the souls of people continue to live after the death of the body.
</li><li>Buddha spent the rest of his life explaining his discoveries to others so that everyone could be freed from suffering. He encapsulated his teachings in a single law: suffering arises from craving; the only way to be fully liberated from suffering is to be fully liberated from craving; and the only way to be liberated from craving is to train the mind to experience reality as it is.
</li><li>Humanism is a belief that Homo sapiens has a unique and sacred nature, which is fundamentally different from the nature of all other animals and of all other phenomena. Humanists believe that the unique nature of Homo sapiens is the most important thing in the world, and it determines the meaning of everything that happens in the universe. The supreme good is the good of Homo sapiens. The rest of the world and all other beings exist solely for the benefit of this species.
</li><li>The White Australia policy which restricted immigration of non-white people to Australia remained in force until 1973.
</li><li>It is an iron rule of history that what looks inevitable in hindsight was far from obvious at the time.
</li><li>We cannot explain the choices that history makes, but we can say something very important about them: history’s choices are not made for the benefit of humans. There is absolutely no proof that human well-being inevitably improves as history rolls along.
</li><li>In the year 1500, there were about 500 million Homo sapiens in the entire world. Today, there are 7 billion.
</li><li>The most important military invention in the history of China was gunpowder. Yet to the best of our knowledge, gunpowder was invented accidentally, by Daoist alchemists searching for the elixir of life. Gunpowder’s subsequent career is even more telling. One might have thought that the Daoist alchemists would have made China master of the world. In fact, the
</li><li>Until the Scientific Revolution most human cultures did not believe in progress. They thought the golden age was in the past, and that the world was stagnant, if not deteriorating.
</li><li>In seventeenth-century England, 150 out of every 1,000 newborns died during their first year, and a third of all children were dead before they reached fifteen.9 Today, only five out of 1,000 English babies die during their first year, and only seven out of 1,000 die before age fifteen.
</li><li>A few serious scholars suggest that by 2050, some humans will become a-mortal (not immortal, because they could still die of some accident, but a-mortal, meaning that in the absence of fatal trauma their lives could be extended indefinitely).
</li><li>Between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, scurvy is estimated to have claimed the lives of about 2 million sailors.
</li><li>An even worse fate befell the natives of Tasmania. Having survived for 10,000 years in splendid isolation, they were completely wiped out, to the last man, woman and child, within a century of Cook’s arrival. European settlers first drove them off the richest parts of the island, and then, coveting even the remaining wilderness,
</li><li>In 1775 Asia accounted for 80 per cent of the world economy. The combined economies of India and China alone represented two-thirds of global production. In comparison, Europe was an economic dwarf.
</li><li>In 1950 western Europe and the United States together accounted for more than half of global production, whereas China’s portion had been reduced to 5 per cent.
</li><li>The discovery of America was the foundational event of the Scientific Revolution. It not only taught Europeans to favour present observations over past traditions, but the desire to conquer America also obliged Europeans to search for new knowledge at breakneck speed.
</li><li>Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, fewer than 5,000 British officials, about 40,000–70,000 British soldiers, and perhaps another 100,000 British business people, hangers-on, wives and children were sufficient to conquer and rule up to 300 million Indians.
</li><li>The British conquered Bengal, the richest province of India, in 1764. The new rulers were interested in little except enriching themselves. They adopted a disastrous economic policy that a few years later led to the outbreak of the Great Bengal Famine. It began in 1769, reached catastrophic levels in 1770, and lasted until 1773. About 10 million Bengalis, a third of the province’s population, died in the calamity.
</li><li>Capitalism distinguishes ‘capital’ from mere ‘wealth’. Capital consists of money, goods and resources that are invested in production. Wealth, on the other hand, is buried in the ground or wasted on unproductive activities.
</li><li>In the sixteenth century, Spain was the most powerful state in Europe, holding sway over a vast global empire. It ruled much of Europe, huge chunks of North and South America, the Philippine Islands, and a string of bases along the coasts of Africa and Asia.
</li><li>The Mississippi Bubble was one of history’s most spectacular financial crashes.
</li><li>In the first half of the nineteenth century, the British East India Company and sundry British business people made fortunes by exporting drugs, particularly opium, to China. Millions of Chinese became addicts, debilitating the country both economically and socially.
</li><li>The annual sugar intake of the average Englishman rose from near zero in the early seventeenth century to around eighteen pounds in the early nineteenth century.
</li><li>From the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, about 10 million African slaves were imported to America. About 70 per cent of them worked on the sugar plantations.
</li><li>The economic pie of 2014 is far larger than the pie of 1500, but it is distributed so unevenly that many African peasants and Indonesian labourers return home after a hard day’s work with less food than did their ancestors 500 years ago.
</li><li>Petroleum had been known for thousands of years, and was used to waterproof roofs and lubricate axles. Yet until just a century ago nobody thought it was useful for much more than that.
</li><li>Pigs are among the most intelligent and inquisitive of mammals, second perhaps only to the great apes.
</li><li>Perhaps 65 million years from now, intelligent rats will look back gratefully on the decimation wrought by humankind, just as we today can thank that dinosaur-busting asteroid.
</li><li>It is especially true of the seven decades that have elapsed since the end of World War Two. During this period humankind has for the first time faced the possibility of complete self-annihilation and has experienced a fair number of actual wars and genocides. Yet these decades were also the most peaceful era in human history – and by a wide margin. This is surprising because these very same decades experienced more economic, social and political change than any previous era.
</li><li>Family and community seem to have more impact on our happiness than money and health. People with strong families who live in tight-knit and supportive communities are significantly happier than people whose families are dysfunctional and who have never found (or never sought) a community to be part of. Marriage is particularly important. Repeated studies have found that there is a very close correlation between good marriages and high subjective well-being, and between bad marriages and misery. This holds true irrespective of economic or even physical conditions.
</li><li>But the most important finding of all is that happiness does not really depend on objective conditions of either wealth, health or even community. Rather, it depends on the correlation between objective conditions and subjective expectations.
</li><li>Some scholars compare human biochemistry to an air-conditioning system that keeps the temperature constant, come heatwave or snowstorm. Events might momentarily change the temperature, but the air-conditioning system always returns the temperature to the same set point.
</li><li>Humans are the outcome of blind evolutionary processes that operate without goal or purpose. Our actions are not part of some divine cosmic plan, and if planet Earth were to blow up tomorrow morning, the universe would probably keep going about its business as usual. As far as we can tell at this point, human subjectivity would not be missed. Hence any meaning that people ascribe to their lives is just a delusion.
</li><li>According to the selfish gene theory, natural selection makes people, like other organisms, choose what is good for the reproduction of their genes, even if it is bad for them as individuals. Most males spend their lives toiling, worrying, competing and fighting, instead of enjoying peaceful bliss, because their DNA manipulates them for its own selfish aims. Like Satan, DNA uses fleeting pleasures to tempt people and place them in its power.
</li><li>Physicists define the Big Bang as a singularity. It is a point at which all the known laws of nature did not exist. Time too did not exist. It is thus meaningless to say that anything existed ‘before’ the Big Bang. We may be fast approaching a new singularity, when all the concepts that give meaning to our world – me, you, men, women, love and hate – will become irrelevant. Anything happening beyond that point is meaningless to us.

</h4><ul><li>Self-esteem shields us against the rumblings of dread that lie beneath the surface of our everyday experience. Self-esteem enables each of us to believe we are enduring, significant beings rather than material creatures destined to be obliterated.
</li><li>In this fashion, over time, being a “good” girl or boy becomes associated with protection and well-being, while being a “bad” girl or boy becomes associated with anxiety and vulnerability. This is why we all need self-esteem—to feel that we are good and valued—and why self-esteem is essential for managing our terror of death.
</li><li>Still, evidence suggests that children as young as three are aware of and uncomfortable about death, and that they begin to employ rudimentary versions of some of the terror management strategies they will come to rely on as adults.
</li><li>“Only old people die. I’m not old. Therefore, as long as I stay young I won’t die.”
</li><li>Take all the cultural trappings away and we are all just generic creatures barraged by a continuous stream of sensations, emotions, and events, buffeted by occasional waves of existential dread, until those experiences abruptly end.
</li><li>Unlike the baboon who gluts himself only on food, man nourishes himself mostly on self-esteem.
</li><li>Research has borne out the fact that we strive for higher self-esteem in the face of mortality. After thinking about their death, Israeli soldiers whose self-esteem was strongly tied to their driving ability drove faster on a simulator. Elsewhere, those who based their self-worth on physical strength generated a stronger handgrip after they thought about death; those who based their self-worth on physical fitness reported increased intentions to exercise; and those who based their self-worth on beauty reported greater concern about their appearance.
</li><li>“The human being inventing [symbols],” Nietzsche contended, “is at the same time the human being who becomes ever more keenly conscious of himself.”
</li><li>The groups of early humans who fabricated the most compelling tales could best manage mortal terror. As a result, they would have been the most capable of functioning effectively in their environment and thereby most likely to perpetuate their genes into future generations.
</li><li>Alternatively, agriculture may have arisen, or been abetted, as an unintended consequence of burial practices. By this account, advanced by science writer and novelist Grant Allen in his 1897 The Evolution of the Idea of God, digging graves tilled the soil and got rid of weeds. Burying the best grains (along with other grave goods) with the corpses was the first planting of seeds; the decaying flesh may incidentally have provided fertilizing nutrients for the seeds. When new plants grew on the grave site the next year, people likely attributed their good fortune to the goodwill of their ancestors or the gods with whom they were believed to be dwelling. Eventually they would have figured out that seeds, sans corpse, would suffice to grow food.
</li><li>Myth making, according to cognitive psychologist Merlin Donald, may have been the original function of elaborated language, rather than providing answers to pragmatic “how-do-I-milk-this-goat?” questions.
</li><li>Otto Rank proposed that the soul is one of humankind’s earliest and most clever inventions, enabling humans to dodge death by perceiving themselves as more than just physical beings. As Rank’s translators put it, “the soul was created in the big bang of an irresistible psychological force—our will to live forever—colliding with the immutable biological fact of death.”
</li><li>Metabolism, de Grey and other scientists believe, is a two-sided coin: while a fast metabolism is great for burning calories and fat, it also contributes to aging because it makes us wear out faster, analogous to driving your car a hundred miles more a day. Aging, they argue, results from toxic by-products of cellular metabolism, the process that turns food into energy. So the fix, de Grey and other scientists think, is to slow down metabolism and clean up the age-promoting waste that it produces. The Taoists did this by eating nothing but berries and roots once a day, and it might have worked; the fewer calories you eat, the slower your metabolism runs. Research by these modern immortalists has showed that mice that ate 30 percent fewer calories lived 40 percent longer than mice that ate as they pleased.
</li><li>As the Egyptians like to say, “to say the names of the dead is to make them live again.”
</li><li>Research around the world confirms that reminders of death increase the desire for children in the service of symbolically transcending death.
</li><li>The fact that some parents disown, abandon, or even murder offspring who stray from their own beliefs suggests that passing on the symbols we cherish can even be more important than passing on our genes.
</li><li>If this sounds superstitious, it is; but research has shown that in fact, people believe that a plane is less likely to crash if a famous person is among the passengers, because proximity to a famous person confers upon you some magical sense of your own immortality.
</li><li>Death enhances our regard for celebrities because they provide proof that being remembered “forever” is possible.
</li><li>Plato and Aristotle emphasized that the majority of men labored “in order that the minority, the élite, might engage in pure exercises of the mind—art, philosophy, and politics.”
</li><li>Other studies have shown that people who view death most negatively are most attracted to high-status material possessions, especially if they have shaky self-esteem.
</li><li>Tennessee Williams’s observation in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof that “the human animal is a beast that dies and if he’s got money he buys and buys and buys and I think the reason he buys everything he can buy is that in the back of his mind he has the crazy hope that one of his purchases will be life everlasting.”
</li><li>“HISTORY,” ERNEST BECKER CONCLUDED, can be viewed as “a succession of immortality ideologies.”

</li><li>Someone expires every thirteen minutes from one of more than six million car crashes that occur every year.
</li><li>First, people with high self-esteem are less fearful of death and therefore less in need of distractions and rationalizations when a real death threat arises—say, a serious heart arrhythmia or a cancerous melanoma. They are better able to confront these matters head-on. Second, optimistic people, who tend to believe that exercise, medical care, and healthy living can effectively prolong their lives, are more likely to seek diagnoses and engage in health-promoting behaviors. Pessimists, who tend to doubt that much can be done, are much more likely to seek distractions or deny the threat.
</li><li>“The majority of suicides,” wrote the great Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno, “would not take their lives if they had the assurance that they would never die on this earth. The self-slayer kills himself because he will not wait for death.” Dostoyevsky came to a similar conclusion in The Possessed, in which the character Pyotr Stepanovich explained his impending suicide: “I wish to deprive myself of life…because I don’t want to have the fear of death.”
</li><li>One of our goals in writing this book was to help awaken us all from the dream of the life we lead when we are totally immersed in our own cultural worldview.

</li><li>One of the most important tasks of adulthood is to discover, or rediscover, the ability to lose oneself
</li><li>Years later, when I would get stuck in a therapy session, my therapist would urge much the same strategy. “Speak without thinking,” he would tell me. I was always surprised to find that I would say just the right thing. The lesson was similar. Speech does not always have to be thought out beforehand. We discover what we need to say when we get out of the way of ourselves.
</li><li>This is, in fact, the heart of the Buddha’s teaching: that it is possible to cultivate a mind that neither clings nor rejects, and that in so doing we can alter the way in which we experience both time and our selves.
</li><li>“At birth I was born alone, and at death too I shall die alone,” asserted the eighth-century Indian Buddhist scholar and saint Shantideva.
</li><li>This is a common frustration at the beginning of spiritual work. Once we discover that it is possible to relax the ego’s grip, we try to package this ability so that it will be there to prop us up. But this attempt at mastery immediately distances us from our goal—it introduces a note of falseness into something that happens naturally if left alone.
</li><li>In an ancient Buddhist sutra called the Anguttara Nikaya the Buddha extolled the value of what he called the “tamed heart,” while warning against the dangers of not being touched in this way. “I know nothing which is as intractable as an untamed heart,…” he declared. “I know nothing which brings suffering as does an untamed, uncontrolled, unattended, and unrestrained heart.… I know nothing which brings joy as does a tamed, controlled, attended, and restrained heart.

</li><li>Delusion is the mind’s tendency to seek premature closure about something. It is the quality of mind that imposes a definition on things and then mistakes the definition for the actual experience. Delusion would have me believe that I was my anxiety and that I was forever isolated as a result. Motivated by fear and insecurity, delusion creates limitation by imposing boundaries. In an attempt to find safety, a mind of delusion succeeds only in walling itself off. In

When they disappointed him, which was virtually inevitable, his resentment would flower into rage and he would become self-righteous or spiteful. He was so vigilant in avoiding dependency that he never learned how to work with these emotions.

</li><li>“I often dream about falling,” wrote Pagels in his book The Cosmic Code. “Such dreams are commonplace to the ambitious or those who climb mountains. Lately I dreamed I was clutching at the face of a rock, but it would not hold. Gravel gave way. I grasped for a shrub, but it pulled loose, and in cold terror I fell into the abyss. Suddenly I realized that my fall was relative; there was no bottom and no end. A feeling of pleasure overcame me. I realized that what I embody, the principle of life, cannot be destroyed. It is written into the cosmic code, the order of the universe. As I continued to fall in the dark void, embraced by the vault of the heavens, I sang to the beauty of the stars and made my peace with the darkness.”

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Sunday, October 8, 2023 11:55:58 AM
</h4><ul><li>Following recovery from depression, patients treated with psychotherapy are more likely to remain undepressed and are significantly less likely to relapse than patients treated with antidepressants alone.
</li><li>Many depressed patients have told me, in fact, that they yearned for death and prayed every night that they would get cancer, so they could die in dignity without having to commit suicide.
</li><li>The first principle of cognitive therapy is that all your moods are created by your “cognitions,” or thoughts. A cognition refers to the way you look at things—your perceptions, mental attitudes, and beliefs. It includes the way you interpret things—what you say about something or someone to yourself. You feel the way you do right now because of the thoughts you are thinking at this moment.
</li><li>In my experience the most crucial predictor of recovery is a persistent willingness to exert some effort to help yourself. Given this attitude, you will succeed.
</li><li>As you apply the various self-help techniques described in this book, take the BDC test at regular intervals to assess your progress objectively. I suggest a minimum of once a week. Compare it to weighing yourself regularly when you’re on a diet.
</li><li>Ideally, I’d like to see your score under five the majority of the time. This is one aim of your treatment.
</li><li>Depression can mimic a great number of medical disorders because your mood swings often create a wide variety of puzzling physical symptoms. These include, to name just a few, constipation, diarrhea, pain, insomnia or the tendency to sleep too much, fatigue, loss of sexual interest, light-headedness, trembling, and numbness. As your depression improves, these symptoms will in all likelihood vanish.
</li><li>I want you to be familiar with the symptoms of mania because a significant percentage of individuals who experience a true major depressive episode will at some later time develop these symptoms.
</li><li>Nearly every depressed person seems convinced beyond all rhyme or reason that he or she is the special one who really is beyond hope. This delusion reflects the kind of mental processing that is at the very core of your illness!
</li><li>The medieval alchemists dreamed of finding some method for transmuting the baser metals into gold. If you have been depressed, you may have developed the talent for doing the exact opposite—you can instantly transform golden joy into emotional lead. Not intentionally, however—you’re probably not even aware of what you’re doing to yourself.
</li><li>Your self cannot be equated with any one thing you do. Your life is a complex and ever-changing flow of thoughts, emotions, and actions. To put it another way, you are more like a river than a statue.
</li><li>First, you cannot earn worth through what you do. Achievements can bring you satisfaction but not happiness. Self-worth based on accomplishments is a “pseudo-esteem,” not the genuine thing!
</li><li>The simple exercise of answering your negative thoughts with rational responses on a daily basis is at the heart of the cognitive method.
</li><li>The written method cannot be bypassed because it exposes to the light of day the illogical nature of the thoughts that trouble you.
</li><li>There is no such thing in this universe as a worthless human being.
</li><li>Labeling yourself as “lazy” is useless and self-defeating because it creates the false impression that your lack of motivation is an irreversible, innate part of your makeup. This kind of thinking does not represent a valid scientific theory, but is an example of a cognitive distortion (labeling).
</li><li>To illustrate how irrational this is, imagine that every time you sat down to eat, you thought about all the food you would have to eat during your lifetime. Just imagine for a moment that all piled up in front of you are tons of meat, vegetables, ice cream, and thousands of gallons of fluids! And you have to eat every bit of this food before you die! Now, suppose that before every meal you said to yourself, “This meal is just a drop in the bucket. How can I ever get all that food eaten? There’s just no point in eating one pitiful hamburger tonight.” You’d feel so nauseated and overwhelmed your appetite would vanish and your stomach would turn into a knot. When you think about all the things you are putting off, you do this very same thing without being aware of it. 4.
</li><li>You assume that you should be able to solve your problems and reach your goals rapidly and easily, so you go into a frenzied state of panic and rage when life presents you with obstacles. Rather than persist patiently over a period of time, you may retaliate against the “unfairness” of it all when things get tough, so you give up completely. I also call this the “entitlement syndrome” because you feel and act as if you were entitled to success, love, approval, perfect health, happiness, etc. Your frustration results from your habit of comparing reality with an ideal in your head. When the two don’t match, you condemn reality. It doesn’t occur to you that it might be infinitely easier simply to change your expectations than to bend and twist reality.
</li><li>Do you know why virtually any meaningful activity has a decent chance of brightening your mood? If you do nothing, you will become preoccupied with the flood of negative, destructive thoughts. If you do something, you will be temporarily distracted from that internal dialogue of self-denigration. What is even more important, the sense of mastery you will experience will disprove many of the distorted thoughts that slowed you down in the first place.
</li><li>An extremely useful way to divide a task into manageable units is through time limitation. Decide how much time you will devote to a particular task, and then stop at the end of the allotted time and go on to something more enjoyable, whether or not you’re finished.
</li><li>Your error is your belief that motivation comes first, and then leads to activation and success. But it is usually the other way around; action must come first, and the motivation comes later on.
</li><li>You will notice you have a profound, almost irresistible tendency to defend yourself when you are unjustly accused. This is a MAJOR mistake! If you give in to this tendency, you will find that the intensity of your opponent’s attack increases! You will paradoxically be adding bullets to that person’s arsenal every time you defend yourself.
</li><li>Early psychoanalysts such as Freud felt that internalized anger was the cause of depression. Unfortunately, there is no convincing evidence in support of this notion.
</li><li>Irrational should statements rest on your assumption that you are entitled to instant gratification at all times. So on those occasions when you don’t get what you want, you go into panic or rage because of your attitude that unless you get X, you will either die or be tragically deprived of joy forever (X can represent love, affection, status, respect, promptness, perfection, niceness, etc.). This insistence that your wants be gratified at all times is the basis for much self-defeating anger. People who are anger-prone often formulate their desires in moralistic terms such as this: If I’m nice to someone, they should be appreciative.
</li><li>Your assumption that they are “being unfair” implies that your way of looking at things is universally accepted.
</li><li>Empathy is the ability to comprehend with accuracy the precise thoughts and motivations of other people in such a way that they would say, “Yes, that is exactly where I’m coming from!”
</li><li>    8.   Frustration results from unmet expectations. Since the event that disappointed you was a part of “reality,” it was “realistic.” Thus, your frustration always results from your unrealistic expectation. You have the right to try to influence reality to bring it more in line with your expectations, but this is not always practical, especially when these expectations represent ideals that don’t correspond to everyone else’s concept of human nature. The simplest solution would be to change your expectations.
</li><li>To put it in a nutshell, remorse or regret are aimed at behavior, whereas guilt is targeted toward the “self.”
</li><li>The first is to ask yourself, “Who says I should? Where is it written that I should?”
</li><li>When you tell yourself, “I should do this” or “I shouldn’t do that” all day long, you get bogged down with a shouldy approach to life. And you already know what you end up with—emotional constipation. If you’d rather get things moving instead, I suggest you try to motivate yourself through rewards rather than punishment. You might find that these work more effectively.
</li><li>In fact, it is your urge to help complainers that maintains the monotonous interaction. Paradoxically, when you agree with their pessimistic whining, they quickly run out of steam.
</li><li>Sadness comes, however, without distortion. It involves a flow of feeling and therefore has a time limit. It never involves a lessening of your self-esteem. Depression is frozen—it tends to persist or recur indefinitely, and always involves loss of self-esteem.
</li><li>Your feelings will result from the meaning you attach to what happens. A substantial portion of your suffering will be due to the distortions in your thoughts. When you eliminate these distortions, you will find that coping with the “real problem” will become less painful.
</li><li>As you begin to feel better, your pessimistic thinking pattern will recede as dramatically and predictably as the melting of winter’s snow when spring arrives. You may even wonder how in the world you came to believe such unrealistic thoughts in the first place.
</li><li>There is a difference between wanting and needing something. Oxygen is a need, but love is a want. I repeat: LOVE IS NOT AN ADULT HUMAN NEED! It’s okay to want a loving relationship with another human being. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a delicious pleasure to be involved in a good relationship with someone you love. But you do not need that external approval, love, or attention in order to survive or to experience maximal levels of happiness.
</li><li>The first step in changing any personal value is to determine if it works more to your advantage or disadvantage.
</li><li>Recognize that there is only one way you can lose a sense of self-worth—by persecuting yourself with unreasonable, illogical negative thoughts. Self-esteem can be defined as the state that exists when you are not arbitrarily haranguing and abusing yourself but choose to fight back against those automatic thoughts with meaningful rational responses. When you do this effectively, you will experience a natural sense of jubilation and self-endorsement. Essentially, you don’t have to get the river flowing, you just have to avoid damming it.
</li><li>“Perfection” is man’s ultimate illusion. It simply doesn’t exist in the universe. There is no perfection. It’s really the world’s greatest con game; it promises riches and delivers misery. The harder you strive for perfection, the worse your disappointment will become because it’s only an abstraction, a concept that doesn’t fit reality. Everything can be improved if you look at it closely and critically enough—every person, every idea, every work of art, every experience, everything. So if you are a perfectionist, you are guaranteed to be a loser in whatever you do.
</li><li>You are guaranteed to be a sure loser if you maintain a standard for evaluating your performance that you can’t ever meet.
</li><li>Dr. Aaron T. Beck reported in a study that suicidal wishes were present in approximately one-third of individuals with a mild case of depression, and in nearly three-quarters of people who were severely depressed.
</li><li>The most serious error you could make with regard to your suicidal impulses is to be overly inhibited in talking them over with a counselor.
</li><li>I would like to emphasize that hopelessness is as much a symptom of depression as a cough is a symptom of pneumonia.
</li><li>For example, recent drug research has shown that patients who do not respond to one antidepressant medication often have a better than average chance of responding to another. This means if you fail to respond to one of the agents, your chances for improvement when you are given another may actually be enhanced. When you consider that there are large numbers of effective antidepressants, psychotherapeutic interventions, and self-help techniques, the probability for eventual recovery becomes tremendously high.
</li><li>Your twisted thoughts and faulty assumptions, not reality, create your suffering. When you learn to look behind the mirrors, you will see that you are fooling yourself, and your suicidal urge will disappear.
</li><li>First of all, let me reemphasize that scientists do not yet know the cause of depression or any other psychiatric disorder. There are lots of interesting theories, but none of them has yet been proven.
</li><li>Several long-term studies indicate that patients who receive cognitive therapy, alone or in combination with antidepressant medications, appear to stay undepressed longer than patients who receive only antidepressant medication therapy and no psychotherapy.5 This is probably because cognitively treated patients have learned many coping tools to help them to deal with any mood problems they might experience in the future.
</li><li>Unlike sleeping pills, opiates, barbiturates, and minor tranquilizers (benzodiazepines), the addictive potential of antidepressants is extremely low. Once the drug is working, you will not need to take larger doses to maintain the antidepressant effect.
</li><li>I have had very few patients who had to remain on antidepressant drugs for more than a year, and almost no patients who stayed on antidepressants indefinitely.

</li><li>Death anxiety is the mother of all religions, which, in one way or another, attempt to temper the anguish of our finitude. God, as formulated transculturally, not only softens the pain of mortality through some vision of everlasting life but also palliates fearful isolation by offering an eternal presence, and provides a clear blueprint for living a meaningful life.
</li><li>“What terrifies most about death is not the loss of the future but the loss of the past. In fact, the act of forgetting is a form of death always present within life.”
</li><li>Every nightmare is a dream in which death anxiety has escaped its corral and menaces the dreamer.
</li><li>Years ago, the psychologist Rollo May quipped that anxiety about nothing tries to become anxiety about something. In other words, anxiety about nothingness quickly attaches itself to a tangible object.
</li><li>I discussed how, for many parents, children often represent an immortality project.
</li><li>Although the physicality of death destroys us, the idea of death saves us.
</li><li>(I always teach my students that understanding the factors that make clients feel better is as important as understanding those that make them feel worse.)
</li><li>Sartre, in his autobiography: “I was going quietly to my end . . . certain that the last burst of my heart would be inscribed on the last page of my work and that death would be taking only a dead man.”
</li><li>I encourage my patients to attend their reunions and to keep a journal of their reactions when they do.
</li><li>If we listen to messages conveyed by powerful dreams we may be awakened.
</li><li>Epicurus believed that the proper mission of philosophy is to relieve human misery. And the root cause of human misery? Epicurus had no doubt about the answer to that question: it is our omnipresent fear of death.
</li><li>Epicurus addressed the unending and unsatisfying search for novel activities by urging that we store and recall deeply etched memories of pleasant experiences. If we can learn to draw on such memories again and again, he suggested, we will have no need for endless hedonistic pursuit.
</li><li>Vladimir Nabokov, the great Russian novelist, in his autobiography, Speak, Memory, which begins with these lines: “The cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness. Although the two are identical twins, man, as a rule, views the prenatal abyss with more calm than the one he is heading for (at some forty-five hundred heartbeats an hour).”
</li><li>Rippling refers to the fact that each of us creates—often without our conscious intent or knowledge—concentric circles of influence that may affect others for years, even for generations. That is, the effect we have on other people is in turn passed on to others, much as the ripples in a pond go on and on until they’re no longer visible but continuing at a nano level. The idea that we can leave something of ourselves, even beyond our knowing, offers a potent answer to those who claim that meaninglessness inevitably flows from one’s finiteness and transiency.
</li><li>Nietzsche said a century ago: ‘When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago.’
</li><li>Otto Rank, one of Freud’s colleagues, who said, “Some refuse the loan of life to avoid the debt of death.”
</li><li>Wealth is like seawater: the more we drink, the thirstier we become. In the end, we don’t have our goods—they have us.
</li><li>“Alice, at the very base of all our feelings about death there is a biological fear that is hardwired into us. I know this fear is inchoate—I’ve experienced it too. It doesn’t have words. But every living creature wishes to persist in its own being—Spinoza said that around 350 years ago. We just have to know this, expect it. The hardwiring will zap us with terror from time to time. We all have it.”
</li><li>Sheer presence is the greatest gift you can offer anyone facing death (or a physically healthy person in a death panic).
</li><li>Think of someone still living toward whom you feel great gratitude that you have never expressed. Spend ten minutes writing that person a gratitude letter and then pair up with someone here, and each of you read your letter to the other. The final step is that you pay a personal visit to that person sometime in the near future and read that letter aloud.
</li><li>Regret has been given a bad name. Although it usually connotes irredeemable sadness, it can be used in a constructive manner. In fact, of all the methods I use to help myself and others examine self-realization, the idea of regret—both creating and avoiding it—is most valuable.
</li><li>The way to value life, the way to feel compassion for others, the way to love anything with greatest depth is to be aware that these experiences are destined to be lost.
</li><li>My father survived that night, but twenty years later he died suddenly in front of our entire family. I was visiting my sister in Washington, D.C., with my wife and three young children. He and my mother had driven over; he sat down in the living room, complained of a headache, and suddenly collapsed.
</li><li>In the envelope was a lost packet of poetry I had written over several years during my adolescence and early adulthood. Among the verses were the identical lines, word for word, that I thought I had freshly composed for the novel. I had actually written them decades earlier, at the time of my fiancée’s father’s death. I had plagiarized myself!
</li><li>Each of us has a powerful desire to revere the great man or great woman, to utter the thrilling words “Your Holiness.” Perhaps this is what Erich Fromm, in Escape from Freedom, meant by “lust for submission.” It is the stuff from which religion emerges.
</li><li>Intimate connections help me overcome the fear of death.
</li><li>To me, transience is like background music: always playing, rarely noticed until some striking event brings it into full awareness.
</li><li>My approach assumes that life (including human life) has arisen from random events; that we are finite creatures; and that, however much we desire it, we can count on nothing besides ourselves to protect us, to evaluate our behavior, to offer a meaningful life schema. We have no predestined fate, and each of us must decide how to live as fully, happily, and meaningfully as possible.
</li><li>Faulkner expressed the same belief: “The aim of every artist is to arrest motion, which is life, by artificial means and hold it fixed so that a hundred years later, when a stranger looks at it, it moves again.”
</li><li>Richard Dawkins, who asks us to imagine a laser-thin spotlight moving inexorably along the immense ruler of time. Everything that the beam has passed is lost in the darkness of the past; everything ahead of the spotlight is hidden in the darkness of the yet to be born. Only what is lit by the laser-thin spotlight lives. This image dispels grimness and evokes in me the thought of how staggeringly lucky I am to be here, alive, and luxuriating in the pleasure of sheer being! And how tragically foolish it would be to diminish my brief time in the life-light by adopting life-negating schemes which proclaim that real life is to be found elsewhere in the utterly indifferent immense darkness ahead of me.
</li><li>Let me adapt some of Nietzsche’s words and say this to you: ‘To become wise you must learn to listen to the wild dogs barking in your cellar.’
</li><li>Heidegger’s thought that when one is consumed with everydayness, one turns away from deeper concerns and from incisive self-examination.

</li><li>Many of us are nervous fliers, despite the fact that, statistically, we would need to fly every day for about 55,000 years before being involved in a fatal plane crash
</li><li>Your perception of reality is the end result of fancy editing tricks: the brain hides the difference in arrival times. How? What it serves up as reality is actually a delayed version. Your brain collects up all the information from the senses before it decides upon a story of what happens. . . . The strange consequence of all this is that you live in the past. By the time you think the moment occurs, it’s already long gone. To synchronize the incoming information from the senses, the cost is that our conscious awareness lags behind the physical world.
</li><li>We now have reason to believe that with access to certain activity inside your brain, another person can know what you’re going to do before you do.
</li><li>Did I decide to write this book? In some sense, the answer is yes, but the “I” in question is not my conscious experience. In actuality, my brain, in conjunction with its history and the outside world, decided. I (my consciousness) simply witness decisions unfolding.
</li><li>Toxoplasma can cause a variety of behavioral changes in humans and is thought to be a trigger for schizophrenia and other mental illnesses in many people. According to McAuliffe’s reporting, “people with schizophrenia are two to three times more likely to test positive for antibodies to the parasite than those who don’t have the disorder.”
</li><li>The self we seem to inhabit most (if not all) of the time—a localized, unchanging, solid center of consciousness—is an illusion that can be short-circuited, without changing our experience of the world in any other way. We can have a full awareness of the usual sights, sounds, feelings, and thoughts, absent the sense of being a self who is the receiver of the sounds and the thinker of the thoughts. This is not at all at odds with modern neuroscience: an area of the brain known as the default mode network, which scientists believe contributes to our sense of self, has been found to be suppressed during meditation.
</li><li>If consciousness were not present in matter, this would imply a theory of strong emergence that is fundamentally anti-scientific. Such emergence is “radically opposed to the spirit of science, which has always attempted to explain the complex in terms of the simple. . . . If the scientific point of view is correct, we shall ultimately find them [signs of consciousness in inert matter], at least in rudimentary form, all through the universe.”
</li><li>Consciousness is an intrinsic property of matter; indeed, it’s the only intrinsic property of matter that we know, for we know it directly, by ourselves being material conscious things. All of the other properties of matter have been discovered by way of mathematical physics, and this mathematical method of getting at the properties of matter means that only relational properties of matter are known, not intrinsic properties.

</h4><ul><li>If you look at the history of most people who are designated heroes in the military and in other places, most of the time they say the reaction they had was without any mental preparation. It was spontaneous, it was without much consideration for the practicalities, the realities of the moment. I think they’re honest when they say they don’t think of themselves as heroes, they just reacted to something they saw as an emergency.
</li><li>The genuinely confident agent does not manufacture confidence, but receives it from the circumstances.
</li><li>The way of life of a culture is not an explicit set of beliefs held by the people living in it. It is much deeper than that. A person brought up in a culture learns its way of life the way he learns to speak in the language and with the accent of his family and peers.
</li><li>Practices that a whole culture takes for granted are extremely difficult to identify.
</li><li>In the medieval tradition suicide is understood as an act of rebellion against God, an attempt to take over from God a decision that is rightfully his. (Indeed, Dante puts the suicides in the seventh of the nine circles of Hell, sitting right beside the blasphemers against God.)
</li><li>“Writing has always been my particular way of translating life,” she explains. “Of taking experiences out of the ephemeral and digesting them, making them real.”
</li><li>“Having a baby is like getting a tattoo on your face. You really need to be certain it’s what you want before you commit.”
</li><li>Look man, we’d probably most of us agree that these are dark times, and stupid ones, but do we need fiction that does nothing but dramatize how dark and stupid everything is? In dark times, the definition of good art would seem to be art that locates and applies CPR to those elements of what’s human and magical that still live and glow despite the times’ darkness. Really good fiction could have as dark a worldview as it wished, but it’d find a way both to depict this world and to illuminate the possibilities for being alive and human in it.10
</li><li>The central challenge of the contemporary world, Wallace seems to think, is not just that we don’t know how to live meaningful lives; it’s that we don’t even seem to be able to focus for very long on the question.
</li><li>Bliss—a-second-by-second joy and gratitude at the gift of being alive, conscious—lies on the other side of crushing, crushing boredom. Pay close attention to the most tedious thing you can find (Tax Returns, Televised Golf) and, in waves, a boredom like you’ve never known will wash over you and just about kill you. Ride these out, and it’s like stepping from black and white into color. Like water after days in the desert. Instant bliss in every atom.
</li><li>The pain of detox, like the hell of boredom, is sustainable only if one builds a wall around each moment. But the experience of doing so gives each moment a kind of vividness, of brilliance and sheen—indeed, a kind of “second-by-second joy and gratitude at the gift of being alive”—that cannot be felt if we step outside the moment.
</li><li>That is the real lesson Wallace wants to get across: that the choice to experience the world as sacred and meaningful—to do so by dint of effort and will—is a choice that is within our power to make. It is a choice that takes strength and courage and persistence, of course; perhaps it takes even a kind of heroism. But it is possible, Wallace thinks. And more than that, it is necessary in the modern world.
</li><li>Western culture in the twentieth century can be read, in part, as a series of responses to the death of God—to the death in the culture, in other words, of a grounded, public, and shared sense that there is a single, unquestioned set of virtues—Judeo-Christian virtues—in accordance with which one’s life is properly led.
</li><li>words, who wishes for some stable ground to stand upon, some externally imposed constraint to guide him in his choice, this person is simply not strong enough, in Nietzsche’s view, to experience the joy of infinite freedom.
</li><li>The notion that blind luck determines the course of our lives leads quickly to the nihilistic idea that our lives have no meaning. Roman Stoicism is grandfather to the nihilism of the secular age.
</li><li>The man who said “I’d rather be lucky than good” saw deeply into life. People are afraid to face how great a part of life is dependent on luck. It’s scary to think so much is out of one’s control. There are moments in a match when the ball hits the top of the net, and for a split second, it can either go forward or fall back. With a little luck, it goes forward, and you win. Or maybe it doesn’t, and you lose.
</li><li>The Greeks, by contrast, held the world in constant wonder. They could not help but be amazed and grateful whenever anything favorable happened in their lives. This kind of amazement and wonder, and the gratitude that follows naturally from it, is the key to everything sacred in the world of the Greeks. TO UNDERSTAND BETTER the Greek sense of the sacred, let us consider an example in which it seems natural to Homer to invoke the presence of the gods. In a representative scene toward the end of the Odyssey, the suitors throw a host of spears at Odysseus from point-blank range. Homer describes the event: Again six suitors cast their shafts with force; but each shot missed its mark—Athena’s work.13 The idea here is that it must not have seemed merely arbitrary or fortunate to Odysseus that these enemy spears missed their mark. It must have seemed to him, rather, that there was some meaning or purpose in this fact, that he was being cared for in the event. Homer’s way of expressing this is to insist that the spears missed Odysseus because Athena was protecting him from the enemy attack. There is something one can retrieve from this description and something one cannot. Obviously we cannot believe that some supernatural entity named Athena actually caused the spears to turn aside. Even if we replace Athena with the Judeo-Christian God, our secular age typically rebels at the thought (though some, of course, will admit this possibility). But whatever the precise metaphysical and theological facts, let us focus on the phenomenology of the situation. Imagine yourself, for the moment, in Odysseus’s place. Six of your enemies have amassed before you at close range; each picks up a spear and together they hurl them at you all at once. You are prepared, as the great warrior always is, to die a heroic death in the following instant. Indeed, it looks inevitable. But instead: One spearhead struck the sturdy hall’s doorpost, and one, the tightly-fitted door itself; two other ash-wood shafts, tipped with stout bronze, just struck the wall. And though two shafts drew close, they leveled nothing more than glancing blows.14 What relief, what amazement, what gratitude one must feel! And can it possibly have been blind chance? By any natural measure, it must seem to Odysseus, things should have gone the other way. One experiences this—or at least Homer’s character experienced it—not just as mere luck or good fortune, but as an event that tells him he is well cared for. Athena’s work indeed. ALTHOUGH WE ARE NOT likely to attribute events like this to the work of a god, there is nevertheless something familiar in Odysseus’s way of experiencing the situation. Those who escape natural disasters or other dangerous situations, for example, often do feel that it was not a mere accident that they were saved. Indeed, it is sometimes difficult—when one is the target of a statistically unlikely event—to feel otherwise. Consider a scene from the movie Pulp Fiction, which provides a contemporary version of the Odysseus event. Jules and Vincent, played by Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, are hit men sent to retrieve a package for their boss. At an apartment they find three of the men who have stolen the package, but are surprised by a fourth man hiding in the bathroom. The fourth man “charges out, silver Magnum raised, firing six booming shots from his hand cannon.”
</li><li>The Greeks, by contrast, held the world in constant wonder. They could not help but be amazed and grateful whenever anything favorable happened in their lives. This kind of amazement and wonder, and the gratitude that follows naturally from it, is the key to everything sacred in the world of the Greeks.
</li><li>Rather, the real question is phenomenological: it is about what ways of experiencing the world and of understanding ourselves have underwritten those further metaphysical and theological claims. The question that really matters, in other words, is not whether God was the causal agent but whether gratitude was an appropriate response.
</li><li>But what is truly important is that the Greeks felt that excellence in a life requires highlighting a central fact of existence: wonderful things outside your control are constantly happening for you. That background sense of human existence is what justified and reinforced the feeling of gratitude that was so central to the Homeric understanding of what is admirable in a life. Whether that gratitude is directed toward Athena, Jesus, Vishnu, or nobody at all is almost irrelevant.
</li><li>For us sleep is the blank episode that separates our moments of activity; when we are sleeping we are no longer quite ourselves. By contrast, in Homer’s world sleep is an event that epitomizes the human condition. It is often in sleep that the gods visit humans, give them direction and purpose, formulate their plans for them, quell their anxieties and refresh their desires.
</li><li>In the middle of the twentieth century the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre worked out the logical extension of this view in his existentialist philosophy. “The first effect of existentialism,” Sartre writes, “is that it puts every man in possession of himself as he is . . .”
</li><li>“A man is not defiled by what goes into his mouth, but by what comes out of it” (Matthew 15:18).
</li><li>Saint Thomas distinguishes between carnal sin and spiritual sin, and that distinction is mirrored in the geography of Dante’s Hell. Carnal sin is loving good things such as food, sex, and material goods, but loving them too much. Such overvaluation is punished outside the wall of Dis. Spiritual sin, by contrast, is rejecting God’s creation.
</li><li>For the Medievals, however, to exclude oneself from bliss in order to save one’s autonomy was the very essence of sin. Dante can thus be read as warning his contemporaries about the evils of autonomy.
</li><li>Dante’s overall view is that the senses, and our desires, are bound by what grabs them, but we have the freedom to form those senses by means of our will and intellect so that the right things grab them.
</li><li>Descartes by contrast, building on Augustine, brought to the fore the idea that we are self-sufficient beings who stand on our own and are defined by our private thoughts and desires. If I want to know who I am, in this Cartesian view, I can do no better than to look within—to ask myself which thoughts I accept as mine.
</li><li>Kant argued famously that Enlightenment means learning finally to take responsibility for your own actions. In other words, the maturity that comes with Enlightenment requires me to obey the Pope or the King only if I freely choose to do so. Autonomy, or setting up one’s own laws and choosing to act in accordance with them—the ultimate sinfulness of the souls in Dante’s Dis—now becomes the highest human good.
</li><li>To take seriously our moods—both our highest soaring joys and our deepest, darkest descents—to live in each of them as moody Ishmael can, to do this is to be open to the manifold truths our moods reveal. These truths are not final and permanent, they are not completed any more than is the mystery of the whale. But it is precisely because of their incompleteness that they are divine and true.
</li><li>The implicit criticism is that Christianity goes astray not in its basic religious impulse, but rather in its totalizing turn. When Christianity accounts itself the one true faith, when it claims a total, unique, and transcendent truth, then it leads to isolation and lack of community. For in its search for some transcendent Divine it forsakes the multiple, communal goods that are already to be found here on earth.
</li><li>The ultimate indifference of Moby Dick toward Ahab could be an indication that this is the way the world really is. Perhaps there really are no meanings, no truths about the purpose of our lives; perhaps the nihilistic story is the final truth. But Melville’s account is subtler than this. Sometimes the universe is meaningless, it is true—sometimes a death is senseless or dumb. But the universe has its brute and reflex-like moments as well, in addition to malicious and vindictive and devilish ones. And in addition to all these, it is also gently joyous and divine.
</li><li>The gods have not withdrawn or abandoned us: we have kicked them out. They are waiting plaintively for us to hear their call. Ask not why the gods have abandoned you, but why you have abandoned the gods.

</h4><ul><li>All of a sudden, I realized that it would not matter to me whether the world existed or whether there was nothing at all anywhere. I began to intuit and sense with all my being, that there was nothing around me. At first I was inclined to think that in the past there had been a great deal, but later on I divined that formerly too there had been nothing, it had merely seemed otherwise for some reason. I gradually became convinced that there would be nothing in the future either.
</li><li>For example, a strange notion suddenly occurred to me, that if I had formerly lived on the moon or on Mars, and had there perpetrated the most shameful and dishonourable action one could possibly imagine, and had been execrated and disgraced, in some fashion that can only be experienced and imagined in occasional dreams, or nightmares, and if, once finding myself back on earth, I were to preserve the awareness of what I had done on that other planet, and moreover knew that I would never go back there under any circumstances—then, looking up at the moon from the earth, would I be indifferent or not?
</li><li>I knew that there existed stars in the deeps of space, whose light took thousands, even millions of years to reach the earth.
</li><li>On our earth we can only truly love suffering, or through it! We know no other way to love and know no other kind of love. I seek to suffer in order to love.
</li><li>AGAIN, you see—well, all right, so it was just a dream! But the feeling of love from those innocent, beautiful people has remained within me ever since, and I sense their love pouring down on me from yonder even now.
</li><li>They desired nothing and were serene, they did not strive for a knowledge of life, as we do, because for them life was complete in itself.
</li><li>I walked among them, wringing my hands, and wept over them, though loving them, perhaps, even more than before, when their faces had not yet developed marks of suffering, when they were innocent and so beautiful. I grew to love the earth they had defiled even more than when it had been a paradise, for the sole reason that grief had appeared upon it.
</li><li>Because I have seen the truth, I’ve seen it and know that people can be beautiful and happy, without losing their ability to live on earth. I won’t accept, and refuse to believe that evil is the normal condition of men.
</li><li>They say: ‘He’s been dreaming, he’s rambling, hallucinations.’ Well, what of it? And they’re so proud of themselves! Dream? What’s a dream? Isn’t this life of ours a dream?
</li><li>The chief thing is to love others as oneself,* that’s the main thing, and that’s it—absolutely nothing more is necessary: you would immediately discover how to bring it about.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Tuesday, October 31, 2023 11:18:29 PM
</h4><ul><li>But I’d have to say, the single most interesting and important connection that I’ve made is the link between anxiety and habits—why we learn to get anxious, and how even that becomes a habit.
</li><li>One of the main things I’ve learned is that in psychiatry, the maxim “the less you know, the more you say” is applicable.
</li><li>Because anxiety generally lives internally rather than manifesting itself as a big growth on the side of someone’s head, I have to ask my patients a bunch of questions to see how their anxiety shows up. I certainly didn’t know that I was anxious back in college until I put two and two together and finally connected my keeping track of all the bathrooms on my running route to worrying.
</li><li>Yes, this is a key characteristic of generalized anxiety: our mind picks an innocuous object and starts worrying about it. For many, anxiety is a wildfire in the wilderness that starts with the strike of a match at dawn and is fueled by everyday experiences, burning brighter and stronger as the day unfolds.
</li><li>To address this question, a study published in JAMA Psychiatry in 2017 looked at rates of Generalized Anxiety Disorder across the globe. Ready for this? Lifetime prevalence was highest in high-income countries (5 percent), lower in middle-income countries (2.8 percent), and lowest in low-income countries (1.6 percent). The authors opined that individual differences in the tendency to worry may show up more under conditions of relative wealth and stability found in high-income countries.
</li><li>A report from the United Kingdom from late April 2020 reported that “mental health had deteriorated” compared with pre-COVID-19 trends. A study in the United States in April 2020 found that 13.6 percent of respondents reported severe psychological distress. That’s a whopping 250 percent increase compared to 2018, where only 3.9 percent reported this level of woe.
</li><li>Anxiety isn’t a loner. It tends to hang out with friends. That same JAMA study from 2017 found that 80 percent of people with GAD experienced another lifetime psychiatric disorder, most commonly depression. A recent study from my lab found something similar: 84 percent of individuals with GAD presented with comorbid disorders.
</li><li>Notice how fear itself does not equal anxiety. Fear is an adaptive learning mechanism that helps us survive. Anxiety, on the other hand, is maladaptive; our thinking and planning brain spins out of control when it doesn’t have enough information.
</li><li>Importantly, like zebras who jump and kick, or dogs who shake their bodies after surviving stressful situations, you need to learn how to safely discharge the excess energy associated with that “I almost died” adrenaline surge, so that it doesn’t lead to chronic or post-traumatic stress and anxiety. Simply talking to someone doesn’t count here; you may really have to do something physical, like shout, shake, dance, or engage in some type of physical exercise.
</li><li>LIKE COVID-19, ANXIETY is also contagious. In psychology, the spread of emotion from one person to another is aptly termed social contagion. Our own anxiety can be cued/triggered simply by talking to someone else who is anxious.
</li><li>Unfortunately, both willpower and reasoning rely on the PFC, which at these critical moments has shut down and isn’t available. Instead, I start by teaching them how their brains work so that they can understand how uncertainty weakens their brain’s ability to deal with stress, priming it for anxiety when fear hits.
</li><li>The rate of change in our world over the last twenty years far outstrips all the changes in the previous two hundred years. Our brains and bodies haven’t kept up, and it’s killing us.
</li><li>This is a crucial moment, so please read this slowly: With the same brain mechanisms as that unnamed cave person, we modern geniuses have gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves with these habits.
</li><li>And here’s the kicker: even though worrying doesn’t work, our old brain keeps trying. Remember, our brain’s job is to help us survive, and because at some point it linked problem-solving with worrying, it thinks worrying is the best way to go. Our brain keeps pulling that worry slot machine lever hoping that it will hit the solution jackpot.
</li><li>As one person in our anxiety program put it, “I am particularly troubled by intense anxiety early in the morning. It wakes me up with a jolt.” This anxious feeling throws their worrying into hyperdrive, as they try to figure out what they are supposed to worry about.
</li><li>Some of these studies have shown that willpower is genetically endowed for a lucky subset; still other studies have argued that willpower is itself a myth. Even studies that acknowledge willpower as real tended to find that people who exerted more self-control were not actually more successful in accomplishing their goals—in fact, the more effort they put in, the more depleted they felt. The short answer is that buckling down, gritting your teeth, or forcing yourself to “just do it” might be counterproductive strategies, possibly helping out in the short term (or at least making you feel like you are doing something) but not working in the long term, when it really counts.
</li><li>Second, while willpower may be fine under normal conditions, when you get stressed (saber-toothed tiger, email from the boss, fight with a spouse, exhaustion, hunger), your old brain takes control and overrides your new brain, basically shutting the latter down until the stress is gone. So exactly when you need your willpower—which resides, remember, in the prefrontal cortex/new brain—it’s not there, and your old brain eats cupcakes until you feel better and your new brain comes back online.
</li><li>“Don’t just do something, sit there!” This is a simple and powerful paradox that has had big effects on me both personally and professionally.
</li><li>The adage “don’t just do something, sit there” also serves as a powerful reminder that being is the doing. In other words, by being there, deeply listening to my patients, I am often doing the best thing I can do for them in that moment: empathizing, understanding, and connecting. Finally, I like the saying because it reminds me that my willpower instinct, which is to do something, is a habit loop itself (well-meaning but misguided), that I can simply observe: observing is really the only necessary “action,” and ironically the most effective one.
</li><li>How rewarding a behavior is drives future behaviors, not the behavior itself. Another way of putting this is that the behavior itself is less important than the result of the behavior; if it were simply a matter of identifying the behavior and then telling someone to stop doing it, I’d happily be out of work. “Just stop doing it” never made it as a slogan for good reason. After years of research and clinical practice, I’m thoroughly convinced that willpower is more a myth than an actual mental muscle.
</li><li>My PhD mentor, Dr. Louis Muglia, taught me the phrase “true, true, and unrelated.” This was his reminder to me when performing experiments in the lab to check for a chain of causality. In other words, I could be studying behavior or process X and seeing Y happen, yet had to prove (to myself, my mentor, and the world) that X caused Y. X could be happening (true). Y could be happening at the same time or right afterward (true). But that didn’t prove that X caused Y to happen.
</li><li>As a side note, depressed individuals seem to be so good at perseverative thinking habit loops that two-thirds of them also meet the psychiatric diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders.
</li><li>When we are sad or anxious all the time, that sadness or anxiety becomes familiar, a place that we gravitate toward, something like a morning routine or a regular route to work. Any deviation feels unfamiliar, perhaps scary or even anxiety-provoking. From a survival standpoint, this makes sense: if we are traveling in unknown territory, we have to be on guard because we don’t know yet if it is safe or not.
</li><li>The why is simple: habits free up our brain to learn new things. But not every action becomes a habit. Your brain has to choose what to lay down as habit and what not to do again. Remember, you learn a habit based on how rewarding the behavior is. The more rewarding a behavior is, the stronger the habit.
</li><li>If you really pay careful and close attention—without making any assumptions or relying on past experience to guide you—and you see that a behavior is not rewarding right now, I promise you that you will start to get less excited about doing it again.
</li><li>Our brains have evolved to try to minimize the amount of pain we have to endure.
</li><li>Dweck advises, “If parents want to give their children a gift, the best thing they can do is to teach their children to love challenges, be intrigued by mistakes, seek new strategies, enjoy effort, and keep on learning. That way, their children don’t have to be slaves of praise. They will have a lifelong way to build and repair their own confidence.”
</li><li>When my students or patients are suffering under the weight of never-ending anxiety, a stubborn habit, or out-of-control addiction, I encourage them to see if they can envision these experiences as teachers. Teachers help us learn. When we learn something, we feel good (it is rewarding). Our best teachers do their magic and help open us to seeing the learning in hardship, even when we are struggling and reflexively close down or turn away from the pain. At these times, I ask my patients and students to see if they can bow to these moments of hardship as teachers, which helps them open up so that they can learn from them, instead of habitually closing down with the first hint of struggle.
</li><li>I love the saying: “Running away from any problem only increases the distance from the solution.”
</li><li>One example would be planning for the future. Planning is like chocolate—a little tastes good, but too much of it can be counterproductive, as it can induce anxiety about what can go wrong.
</li><li>When something is really ridiculous or absurd, it becomes hard to take it seriously anymore, so it no longer has such a hold on you. Thus, mindfulness can help you pay much closer attention to what your mind is caught up in and allow you to see how absurd it is that something sucks merely because you convinced yourself that it was going to suck.
</li><li>“Forgiveness is giving up hope of a better past.”
</li><li>Our modern neural networks are still very much in hunter-gatherer (and not be hunted) mode. This means that reward-based learning shows up every time we smoke a cigarette, eat a cupcake, or check our email or news feed when we’re stressed: basically, each time we reach out for something to soothe ourselves, we reinforce the learning, to the point where it becomes automatic and habitual. This is how we end up stuck in anxiety (and other) loops.
</li><li>Sean Parker, one of Facebook’s “founding fathers,” whose equity therein made him a billionaire, bluntly explained that Facebook is “a social validation feedback loop . . . exactly the kind of thing a hacker like myself would come up with, because you’re exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.” He continued to explain that early in Facebook’s development, the objective was “to consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible.”
</li><li>For example, becoming clearly aware that smoking doesn’t taste good reduces the reward value of smoking cigarettes (second gear), but people don’t stand idly by on their smoke breaks doing nothing if they aren’t smoking. Idleness quickly gives way to boredom and restlessness, which themselves don’t feel particularly pleasant. In many paradigms for addiction treatment, the solution calls for a substitute behavior.
</li><li>Mindfulness might fit the bill. This is really important, so I’m going to repeat it: mindfulness might actually give you more satisfying rewards, as in a substitute that has bigger, better rewards but without the baggage of feeding the craving (more on that later).
</li><li>At peak curiosity, dopamine pathways in the brain fired with increased intensity and there was a stronger connection between reward centers and the hippocampus, a brain area associated with memory. Peak curiosity primed students to remember more information—not just the answers to their trivia questions.
</li><li>The Stress Test is amazing! To actually feel where in the body the stress is held and then to “drill down” into the actual sensations totally changes the experience. In the process of turning toward the stress and discomfort, I find they [bodily sensations] transform into sources of keen interest and lose the negative “spin” I put on them. Curiosity trumps anxiety!
</li><li>Ironically, while he was enjoying significant calm stretches, which felt strange and different, his brain would chime in, wondering if there was something wrong (wearing those old habit glasses), whether he should be anxious.
</li><li>(One of my favorites is Mindfulness in Plain English, by Bhante Henepola Gunaratana.)
</li><li>Amy had fallen into a mental trap, just like way too many other people. They think that if they can just figure out why they are anxious, that discovery will magically fix their anxiety. This works just fine when it comes to fixing cars and dishwashers, but our minds can’t be fixed like appliances.
</li><li>With mindfulness training, the why/what distinction is critical. Instead of getting caught in the why, anxious people learn to focus on what is happening right in that moment. What thoughts are they having? What emotions are they feeling? What sensations are showing up in their bodies?
</li><li>“Whenever you notice a why habit loop developing, take three deep breaths. Breathe in deeply, and on the exhale, say to yourself, Why doesn’t matter.”
</li><li>One of our community members said that she felt like a “human doing rather than a human being.” She explained that she was doing, doing, doing as a way to try to make herself feel better; but she had gotten lost in the process of doing and had stopped being.
</li><li>In psychology, our tendency to register and continue to ruminate on negative stimuli and events more than positive ones is known as negativity bias (aka positive-negative asymmetry). That’s why the sting of a rebuke is felt more powerfully than the joy of praise.
</li><li>As is true in assembling a beaded necklace, time is a concept that strings together “this moment” that just happened a second ago to the “this moment” of the present. As the bead from this moment passes into the past, that narrative necklace gets longer, stringing together the story of our lives.
</li><li>Over the years, seeing that review sticking at the number one slot must have subconsciously left an impression in my brain, like the small dent in your car that triggers you to relive the “dent moment” each time you see it and then prompts you to rub your fingers over it, as though that action will somehow magically make it go away.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Saturday, November 4, 2023 5:58:32 PM
</h4><ul><li>But then “Siberia,” historically, has been less a geographical designation than a state of mind, a looming threat—the frozen hell on earth to which czarist and Communist Russias sent their political undesirables. By this definition, Siberia is not so much a place as it is a hardship to endure, and perhaps that’s what Vladimir means when he says that we are in Siberia.
</li><li>After the bodies were transported back to civilization, the forensic analysis proved baffling. While six of the nine had perished of hypothermia, the remaining three had died from brutal injuries, including a skull fracture. According to the case files, one of the victims was missing her tongue. And when the victims’ clothing was tested for contaminants, a radiologist determined certain articles to contain abnormal levels of radiation.
</li><li>They were all Grade II hikers, but if this particular excursion went as planned, the group would be awarded Grade III certification upon their return. It was the highest hiking certification in the country at the time, one that required candidates to cover at least 186 miles (300 kilometers) of ground, with a third of those miles in challenging terrain. The minimum duration of the trip was to be sixteen days, with no fewer than eight of those spent in uninhabited regions, and at least six nights spent in a tent. If the hikers met these conditions, their new certification would allow them to teach others their craft as Masters of Sport.
</li><li>In mid-July, as the country’s civil war continued to roil and the anti-Communist White Army threatened to take back the city, the order was given to execute the entire royal family. In the early morning hours of July 17, the czar and czarina, along with their five children and various attendants, were brought to the building’s basement where they were lined up—ostensibly for a family photograph—and executed at point-blank range.
</li><li>I wondered how many fretful mothers throughout history had been ignored by their obstinate children, only to see their nightmares realized. As if the loss weren’t enough, these mothers were sentenced to a life of regret and of hearing the same refrain repeating uselessly in their heads: I told you so.
</li><li>Then what did Yudin believe? In response to my questions, he made it clear that he didn’t think the fate of his friends had anything to do with natural phenomena. “The number one possibility in my mind,” he said, “is that it was people who came with guns because they were in an area they shouldn’t have been in or they saw something they shouldn’t have seen.”
</li><li>The clue that most convinced Yudin that the hikers had been led by gunpoint was Lyuda’s missing tongue. The reigning skeptic’s interpretation was that nine bodies lying out in the open for days and weeks are going to attract animals, and that, not unlike the bird that damaged Georgy’s face, the soft tissue of Lyuda’s tongue had been a target for rodents. Yudin, however, doubted this explanation. “If it had been a mouse, it would have happened to everyone, to all the bodies.” Instead, he believed someone had singled out Lyuda for punishment, possibly because she had been the most strong-willed and outspoken of the group. “Was it just an animal, or did she talk too much and that was a warning from government officials?”
</li><li>In addition, a charm that Lyuda carried with her everywhere, a small stuffed toy in the shape of a hedgehog, had not been found on her body. “She always carried it with her, but it was missing.”
</li><li>And I didn’t tell him how conflicted I felt about having self-financed this entire three-year endeavor, maxing out credit cards and draining my savings account—all the while starting a family.
</li><li>Vertigo can manifest itself as nausea, vomiting and loss of equilibrium. I tend to experience all three. With my last attack, I had been useless for forty-eight hours, either curled up in bed or positioned over a toilet bowl, completely unable to focus and barely able to walk. I had been so dehydrated from repeated vomiting that during my ambulance ride to the hospital, paramedics had been unable to locate a vein in which to pump fluids into my system.
</li><li>“They saw a strange phenomenon in the evening to the north from their locations: the extremely bright light of some rocket,” Krivonishchenko remembered. “The light was so bright that even those hikers who were preparing to sleep in tents went out to look at it. For some time, the sound of strong thunder came from afar.”
</li><li>“My personal feeling was that some celestial body was falling our way, but when it grew so large, I thought that some planet was coming in contact with Earth and that they would collide and Earth would perish.”
</li><li>“[I]n the first days of the investigation Ivanov reiterated that the students had died not of natural causes, and it had been a murder.”
</li><li>In mid-March, Ivanov was called away to Moscow for reasons that he would not disclose to others in his office. Upon his return, Karelin and others noticed a pronounced change in his demeanor. “[W]e could not recognize him when he returned,” Karelin said years later. “He didn’t mention murder or spheres anymore. And he’d often advise us to ‘hold our tongues.’
</li><li>His data showed that it was extremely unlikely for a soft, slab or slush avalanche to have occurred. The slope’s “run-out angle”—the angle that determines how far an avalanche will move—was 16 degrees from the top of the slope to the tent’s location. At 16 degrees, it would be nearly impossible for an avalanche to travel half the distance of a football field over such a flat surface to reach the tent. The slope angle below the tent was 25 degrees, which would be steep enough to slide only in the rarest conditions.
</li><li>I couldn’t conceive of how the hikers could have left their tent improperly clothed—most without shoes—to walk almost a mile to the cedars along the horizon. It took us well over an hour to walk half a mile in these conditions, and we were equipped with warmer clothing and modern hiking gear.
</li><li>The reaction of Alexander Dubinin might have vindicated the investigator’s decision to keep the caskets closed. Dubinin was so horrified by the condition of his daughter’s body that he fainted on the spot.
</li><li>Just one day before the radiation tests were to come back from the lab, Ivanov bowed to pressure from his regional superiors to terminate the criminal investigation, effective immediately. Though Ivanov did have the option to apply for a one-month extension, it would have been unusual to do so in a case in which the bodies had already been found. Additionally, applying for an extension would have put immense stress on Ivanov to produce conclusive new evidence within a month. And so on May 28, without being able to follow through on the tests that he himself had ordered, Ivanov closed the Dyatlov case, citing no particular cause for the hikers’ deaths.
</li><li>He is director of the Forest Service Utah Avalanche Center and author of Staying Alive in Avalanche Terrain. After reviewing the data, he concluded: “It is highly unlikely that an avalanche hit the hikers’ tent or surrounding area.”
</li><li>Dr. Straus was able to determine, upon first glance, that by today’s scientific understanding of radiation levels, the beta particle decays cited in the criminal case for the hikers’ clothing were nowhere near an abnormal range. They would have had to be 50 to 100 times the level detected to reach dangerous or alarmingly abnormal levels of radiation.
</li><li>Additionally, the dark or “orange” color of the hikers’ skin is more plausibly explained as a severe tan or sunburn, rather than exposure to radiation. Before becoming buried in snow, the bodies likely had lain out for many days.
</li><li>Per Soviet law, criminal case files were to be stored in the prosecutor’s office for twenty-five years. If no appeals were filed for the case during that time, the entire case could be legally destroyed. The Soviet government had its chance to completely destroy the Dyatlov case files, but it chose not to.
</li><li>I’m not saying I don’t entertain the idea of life existing out there somewhere in the vast universe, but if one is going to fall back on malevolent alien visitors without backing it up with evidence, one may as well throw ghosts, the hand of God, and devious subterranean gnomes into the mix. Aliens were off the table.
</li><li>A pioneer in the biological effects of infrasound was the Russian-born, French scientist Vladimir Gavreau, who discovered its impact on the body entirely by accident. During the 1960s, Gavreau and his laboratory assistants started experiencing inexplicable nausea, pain in their eardrums and shaking lab equipment—all with no apparent cause. When all chemical and airborne sources were ruled out, Gavreau eventually concluded that inaudible, low-frequency sounds waves were being generated by the motor of a large fan-and-duct system in the building where his lab was located.
</li><li>The Toronto Sun reported an incident from June 6, 2005, in which witnesses described a minute-long blast of sound emanating from a white Israeli military vehicle. Within seconds, protesters began falling to their knees, experiencing symptoms similar to seasickness. An Israeli military source said that such tactics are intended to “disperse crowds with sound pulses that create nausea and dizziness.”
</li><li>I then sent Bedard a quote from the 1959 criminal case, in which an Ivdel local describes the weather of this region: “In winter in the northern Ural Mountains, and even in the summer, there can be strong winds and sometimes whirlwinds. . . . During whirlwinds, various sounds arise in the mountains, terrifying and foreign, like the howls of animals or human moans. . . . You get scared when you are there, and those who haven’t heard anything like that can become frightened.”
</li><li>“I can imagine they’re all in the tent,” Bedard said. “They start to hear the winds pick up. . . . Then to the south they start to feel a vibration in the ground. They hear a roar that seems to pass them from west to east. They start to feel more vibration in the floor, the fabric of the tent vibrates. Another roar of a freight train passes by, this time from the north. . . . The roaring sounds turn horrifying, their chest cavities begin to vibrate from the infrasound created by the stronger vortex now passing. Effects of infrasound are beginning to be felt by the hikers—panic, fear, trouble breathing—as physiological frequencies are generated.”
</li><li>ON FEBRUARY 15, 2013, THE DAY AFTER I RETURNED HOME from Boulder, an infrasound event hit western Siberia. I didn’t initially connect the event to infrasound. Like most people who read the news that morning, I registered the occurrence as a gee-whiz oddity—if an alarming one. Just after dawn, at 9:20 local time, a twelve-thousand-ton meteor exploded in the sky over the Ural Mountains, 120 miles south of Yekaterinburg. NASA scientists estimated its diameter to have been 55 feet, making it the largest meteor to hit Earth’s atmosphere in over a century since the Tunguska meteor event of 1908. That meteor—thought to have been approximately 130 feet across—had resulted in an explosion that flattened 800 square miles of forest in central Siberia, with a blast several hundred times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Wednesday, November 8, 2023 11:05:04 PM
</h4><ul><li>When it occurs, failure puts a distance between us and the world, and between ourselves and others. That distance gives us the distinct feeling that we don’t fit in, that we are out of sync with the world and others, and that there is something amiss. All of this makes us seriously question our place under the sun. And that may be the best thing to happen to us: this existential awakening is exactly what we need if we are to realize who we are.
</li><li>To be “sick for good,” to “throw up for good”—there is hardly a better way to describe our existential predicament.
</li><li>And how, you may ask, are we to tell real failure from fake failure, of the kind peddled by self-help gurus? It is simple: failure always humbles. If it doesn’t, it’s not real failure, it’s just “a stepping-stone to success”—self-deception by another name. And that does not lead to healing but to even more sickness.
</li><li>“The world,” we read in the Gnostic Gospel of Philip, “came about through a mistake.” The one who made it “wanted to create it imperishable and immortal,” but he “fell short of attaining his desire.” For “the world never was imperishable, nor, for that matter, was he who made the world.”
</li><li>The demiurge’s bringing the world into existence as a failed act is present in virtually all the Gnostic cosmogonic narratives, which reinforce the same point, over and over: the creation of the world was an unfortunate event, which the demiurge should not have engaged in, because such work was beyond his capabilities. He was driven by passion, ignorance, and recklessness.
</li><li>Yet the more she suffered, the more she understood, and since she came to suffer beyond measure, her understanding became prodigious.
</li><li>When we experience failure, we start seeing cracks in the fabric of existence and the nothingness that stares at us from the other side.
</li><li>For it is this lurking, constant threat—the abyss below—that should make us aware of the extraordinariness of existence: that we exist at all when there is no obvious reason why we should.
</li><li>Granted, this is no flattering knowledge: you find yourself nothing but a creature of chance, the icon of flimsiness, a brief flickering. You are cast in some cosmic farce, nothing but a plaything, a walking joke. Yet even as you gain this knowledge you realize the magnitude of your accomplishment: you see yourself as you are, you’ve reached a state of ontological nakedness—and you get the joke.
</li><li>Slavery, Weil discovered, gives us direct access to the ultimate, redeeming humility. “There is no greater humility than to wait in silence and patience,” she wrote in one of her notebooks. “It is the attitude of the slave who is ready for any order from the master, or for no order.”
</li><li>Trained and fed and taken care of by algorithms as we increasingly are, our mind is largely jobless. And when thinking is not employed, it atrophies and dies.
</li><li>Most of us, whether we know it or not, suffer from a peculiar condition: the umbilicus mundi syndrome, a pathological inclination to place ourselves at the center of everything, and to fancy ourselves far more important than we are.
</li><li>“I always believed,” she had written not long before, “that the instant of death is the center and object of life.… I never desired any other good for myself.”
</li><li>“The humble man,” writes Murdoch, “because he sees himself as nothing, can see other things as they are.”
</li><li>The grand scenario is pretty much the same: this world (a failed creation) came into existence somehow, but it doesn’t really represent the true God; we find ourselves entangled in the thickness of matter, yet we sense this is not our real homeland; we are born with an urge to leave the place, which will guide our efforts to escape; finding our way back is a redemptive process that takes superior knowledge (gnosis).
</li><li>In her Notebooks, Weil depicts the situation in unforgettable imagery: In relation to God, we are like a thief who has burgled the house of a kindly householder and been allowed to keep some of the gold. From the point of view of the lawful owner this gold is a gift; from the point of view of the burglar it is a theft.… It is the same with our existence. We have stolen a little of God’s being to make it ours.
</li><li>“Death is the most precious thing which has been given to man,” Weil wrote in Gravity and Grace. “That is why the supreme impiety is to make bad use of it. To die amiss.”
</li><li>The “mystery of man’s being is not only in living, but in what one lives for,” says the Grand Inquisitor. “Without a firm idea of what he lives for, man will not consent to live and will sooner destroy himself than remain on earth, even if there is bread all around him.”
</li><li>“You cannot teach non-violence to a man who cannot kill,” Gandhi used to say.
</li><li>History—the only true guide we have on this matter—has shown us that true democracy is rare and fleeting. It flares up almost mysteriously in some fortunate place or another, and then fades out just as mysteriously. Genuine democracy is difficult to achieve and, once achieved, fragile. In the grand scheme of human events, it is the exception, not the rule.
</li><li>Inadvertently perhaps, Gandhi’s South African correspondent stumbled upon one of the key features of the Gandhian approach to life: settle for nothing but failure. Failure can be used as a technique for living. To lead a good life, you need to posit yourself as a site of perpetual disappointment: you start from the worst person you could possibly be, and then, gradually, build yourself up from there. By this method, your life acquires worthiness to the extent that you can extract it from failure. The more you fail, the better your chance to realize your worth.
</li><li>“Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent,” observed George Orwell in his “Reflections on Gandhi.”
</li><li>Nietzsche rightly talks of the “death of God” as an event of catastrophic proportions. To come up with a new source of meaning, of a similar authoritative power, would take nothing less than an Übermensch.
</li><li>“When people stop believing in God, it’s not that they believe in nothing, it’s that they believe in anything.”
</li><li>said, If I need only one shirt to cover myself with but use two, I am guilty of stealing one from another. For a shirt which could have been of use to someone else does not belong to me. If five bananas are enough to keep me going, my eating a sixth one is a form of theft.
</li><li>“The process of eating is as unclean as evacuation,” he would say, “the only difference being that, while evacuation ends in a sense of relief, eating, if one’s tongue is not held in control, brings discomfort.”
</li><li>Originally designed to neutralize political undesirables, the labor camps soon became a major economic force in the Soviet Union. They were “at the heart of the Soviet economy,” concludes historian Anne Applebaum,
</li><li>All humans are mortal, but the Hitlers and the Stalins of this world never truly die—they only change names. We know everything about their deeds, but this will not prevent others from committing them again.
</li><li>“People who succeed are loved because they exude some magical formula for fending off destruction, fending off death,” he says. “It’s the most brutal way of looking at life that one can imagine, because it discards anyone who does not measure up. It wants to destroy them.… It’s a moral condemnation that goes on. You don’t want to be near this failure.”
</li><li>For Cioran, as for Montaigne several centuries earlier, writing has a performative function: you write to act upon yourself—to pick up the pieces after a personal disaster or to pull yourself out of a bad depression; to come to terms with a deadly disease or to mourn the loss of a close friend. You write not to go mad, not to kill yourself or others. In a conversation with the Spanish philosopher Fernando Savater, Cioran says at one point, “If I didn’t write, I could have become an assassin.”
</li><li>“The poor, by thinking unceasingly of money, reach the point of losing the spiritual advantages of non-possession, thereby sinking as low as the rich.”
</li><li>He was not joking—or only half. It was his belief that, in a meaningless world, there is no reason to do anything whatsoever. “All action is fundamentally useless,” thought this modern pillar saint. “I believe that the only right moment in history is the ancient period of India, when one would live a life of contemplation, when one would be content just to look at things, without ever dealing with them.”
</li><li>He learns what good actors and spies have always known: you are what you put on. You become your disguise. The others almost always see the mask, never the person; indeed, the person is the mask (persona, in Latin).
</li><li>Socially, we are never what we think we are, but whatever others make us out to be. A man of means with the appearance of a tramp is a tramp. If you put on a tramp’s clothes, for all intents and purposes, you become one. “Clothes are powerful things,” Orwell concludes. “Dressed in a tramp’s clothes it is very difficult … not to feel that you are genuinely degraded.”
</li><li>The sight of the loser is unsettling because it reminds us of the worst things that can befall us: degradation, dissolution, destitution.
</li><li>“Because failure, always essential, reveals us to ourselves, permits us to see ourselves as God sees us, whereas success distances us from what is most inward in ourselves and indeed in everything.”
</li><li>It’s the same pattern, over and over again: existence is found to be outrageous, plain awful, and yet somehow in that very awfulness there lies a promise of redemption. Life is unbearable, insomnia a killer, le cafard is eating at you slowly, and yet this is something that you can handle through writing. “Everything that is expressed becomes more tolerable.”94 Writing is a magnificent witchcraft that acts upon its practitioners and renders their lives a touch more livable. A catastrophe, to the extent that it is narratable, carries within itself the seeds of its own redemption.
</li><li>There are some twenty-five thousand subcastes in India. Forward-looking Indians today find the system not only antiquated but repugnant and would like it abolished. Yet, ironically, most of them remain oblivious to the new income- and status-based stratification and fail to see how much alike the two caste systems in fact are: under both arrangements, people live in separate quarters, do different jobs, speak differently, eat differently, behave differently, and consider themselves different.
</li><li>While most would say that capitalism is an arms race for success, it could also be called the “failure game.” For it is failure that lies at the core of the capitalist idea: regardless of my actual wealth, I can differentiate myself from others only to the extent that they fail to amass as much wealth as I do. I may be very poor, but I can still differentiate myself from someone who is poorer than me. And that keeps me going. As well as the whole system.
</li><li>According to a children’s book from 1852, for example, to fail was simply “to be unable to pay one’s debts,” and a “loser” was nothing more dramatic than someone who lost something. “Loser” was at the time “a neutral word for anybody who lost property, often by theft or natural disaster,” Sandage writes. To illustrate the point, he quotes from a newspaper article in the aftermath of the 1820 Boston fire: “the keeper of the hotel, is a great loser, particularly in furniture and liquors.”
</li><li>If we are to make any progress, we need to make a full stop first. We will never discover—let alone realize—ourselves while caught up in the maelstrom. As long as we keep ourselves compulsively busy, we cannot understand much—least of all where we are going.
</li><li>No matter how far we run away from people, or how carefully we wrap ourselves up in our own solitude, society will always catch up. Not only because solitude is conceived in relation to others, but because we are compelled to use language—an eminently social product—to think or speak even to ourselves.
</li><li>The capacity to kill oneself is “one of man’s distinctive characteristics,” writes Cioran. “No animal is capable of it, and the angels have scarcely guessed its existence.”
</li><li>The self we eventually weave is not just the sum total of what we have done, but also of a long series of absences: all that we’ve longed for but never got, the love that was not reciprocated, the unkept promises, the missed opportunities, the unfulfilled desires, all that we have only imagined or fantasized about, or have not even dared to dream. The missing parts may be more important than the real ones.
</li><li>“In the long run, you’ve got to live,” pronounces the popular wisdom. “But do you have to live?” retorts Améry. “Do you always have to be there just because you were there once? In the moment before the leap, suicides tear to pieces a prescription of nature and throw it at the feet of the invisible prescriber.”
</li><li>Dazai’s writing is the shattering testimony of someone fated to observe life from its outer edges, one foot always hanging perilously over the abyss.
</li><li>“As soon as a man comes to life, he is at once old enough to die.”
</li><li>Rehearse your death every morning and night. Only when you constantly live as though already a corpse (jōjū shinimi) will you be able to find freedom in the martial way, and fulfill your duties without fault throughout your life.
</li><li>Every morning, when we wake up, there is a moment—the briefest of moments—when our memory hasn’t come back to us. We are not yet ourselves because we don’t have a story to tell. We can be anyone at this stage, but right now we are no one.
