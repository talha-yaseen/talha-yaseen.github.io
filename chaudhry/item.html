			<h3>Alpinestars Missile Perforated Leather Jacket For Tech Air Race</h3>
			<p>Somehow, &quot;Missile&quot; doesn&#39;t quite do it justice. The way Tech Air technology has exploded onto the motorcycle protection market, the Alpinestars &quot;Surface-to-Air Laser-Guided Warhead&quot; Perforated Leather Jacket would have been much more appropriate.</p><p>The Missile is prepared to accept the Tech Air Race Vest airbag system (sold separately), which uses onboard sensors and a sophisticated algorithm to detect a crash situation and deploy airbag coverage in that critical fraction of a second, protecting the rider&#39;s back, chest, shoulders and kidneys.</p><p>The jacket itself is constructed of premium race-grade 1.3 mm genuine cow leather, punctuated with strategically-placed accordion stretch gussets and stretch fabric panels to allow for maximum mobility on the motorcycle. CE certified Alpinestars GP-R protectors and external sliders at the joints make the Missile ready for a high speed slide, while localized perforation and an airflow-optimized back hump ensure you stay cool during the ride.</p>
			<h3>Tech Air Race Ready</h3>
			<p>This Missle Leather Jacket is built to accept the Tech Air Race Airbag System. The vest, which must be purchased separately, installs easily in just a few minutes and does not require any external sensors to operate. Should it detect a crash, it will deploy a protective airbag, providing unrivaled protection to the rider's full back, shoulders, kidney area and chest.</p>
