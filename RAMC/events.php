			<h3>Day 1 - Carnival/Bonfire</h3>
			<p>To be held on the first day of the event, the carnival will feature rides, food stalls, and a ballin&#39; time for everyone. Along with this, we&#39;ll have a bonfire to fight that January evening chill.</p>

			<h3>Day 2 - Concert</h3>
			<p>A staple of MUNs and debates conferences, especially in Islamabad, the concert will feature a surprise performer, great music, and an all-round great show for everyone to enjoy. What&#39;s great is that the tickets aren&#39;t limited to only delegates, so the concert is going to be even bigger than the itself (if that&#39;s possible).</p>

			<h3>Day 3 - Formal Dinner</h3>
			<p>MIBAC is all about the debates in the end, and the formal dinner is what brings it all to a beautiful end. The award ceremony, and the end of a revolutionary event. The formal dinner is considered by some to be one of the most significant parts of the event.</p>
