</li><li>The immune cells residing in your gut make up the largest component of your body’s immune system; in other words, there are more immune cells living in the wall of your gut than circulating in the blood or residing in your bone marrow.
</li><li>The gut is also the largest storage facility for serotonin in our body. Ninety-five percent of the body’s serotonin is stored in these warehouses.

</li><li>As you sat fuming about the driver who cut you off, your stomach went into vigorous contractions, which increased its production of acid and slowed the emptying of the scrambled eggs you ate for breakfast. Meanwhile your intestines twisted and spit mucus and other digestive juices. A similar yet distinct pattern happens when you’re anxious or upset. When you’re depressed, your intestines hardly move at all. In fact, we now know that your gut mirrors every emotion that arises in your brain.
</li><li>This led the pharaoh to name an appointee known as “keeper of the rectum,” whose job was to manage the royal enemas—one of history’s first truly rough gigs.
</li><li>It’s well known that this excessive animal fat intake, together with excessive sugar intake, is a contributing factor to the American obesity epidemic. But it’s perhaps less well known that a diet high in animal fat can also contribute to overconsumption of food and even food addiction—and our gut microbes may play an important role in this connection. On the other hand, recent epidemiological evidence suggest that diets low in animal fat, such as the Mediterranean diet, don’t just have positive consequences for your waistline, metabolism, and cardiovascular health. Such diets are also associated with a lower risk for certain cancers and serious brain diseases such as depression, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s disease.
</li><li>We know now from animal experiments that a regular high-fat diet can numb the satiety response both at the gut and the brain level, reducing your ability to tell when you’ve eaten enough. There is solid evidence that it does this in both locations by causing low-grade inflammation. In the gut, that inflammation reduces sensitivity to satiety signals by sensors on the vagus nerve, which normally tell your hypothalamus that you’re full. In your hypothalamus, it reduces sensitivity to satiety signals arriving from the gut.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Friday, July 30, 2021 12:23:40 PM
</h4><ul><li>The root of humanly caused evil is not man’s animal nature, not territorial aggression, or innate selfishness, but our need to gain self-esteem, deny our mortality, and achieve a heroic self-image. Our desire for the best is the cause of the worst.
</li><li>Freud’s explanation for this was that the unconscious does not know death or time: in man’s physiochemical, inner organic recesses he feels immortal.
</li><li>Everything painful and sobering in what psychoanalytic genius and religious genius have discovered about man revolves around the terror of admitting what one is doing to earn his self-esteem.
</li><li>Therefore in normal times we move about actually without ever believing in our own death, as if we fully believed in our own corporeal immortality. We are intent on mastering death…. A man will say, of course, that he knows he will die some day, but he does not really care. He is having a good time with living, and he does not think about death and does not care to bother about it—but this is a purely intellectual, verbal admission. The affect of fear is repressed.
</li><li>the essence of man is really his paradoxical nature, the fact that he is half animal and half symbolic.
</li><li>Yet, at the same time, as the Eastern sages also knew, man is a worm and food for worms. This is the paradox: he is out of nature and hopelessly in it; he is dual, up in the stars and yet housed in a heart-pumping, breath-gasping body that once belonged to a fish and still carries the gill-marks to prove it. His body is a material fleshy casing that is alien to him in many ways—the strangest and most repugnant way being that it aches and bleeds and will decay and die. Man is literally split in two: he has an awareness of his own splendid uniqueness in that he sticks out of nature with a towering majesty, and yet he goes back into the ground a few feet in order blindly and dumbly to rot and disappear forever.
</li><li>If we had to offer the briefest explanation of all the evil that men have wreaked upon themselves and upon their world since the beginnings of time right up until tomorrow, it would be not in terms of man’s animal heredity, his instincts and his evolution: it would be simply in the toll that his pretense of sanity takes, as he tries to deny his true condition.
</li><li>We read that men of the Chagga tribe wear an anal plug all their lives, pretending to have sealed up the anus and not to need to defecate.
</li><li>The upsetting thing about anality is that it reveals that all culture, all man’s creative life-ways, are in some basic part of them a fabricated protest against natural reality, a denial of the truth of the human condition, and an attempt to forget the pathetic creature that man is.
</li><li>Excreting is the curse that threatens madness because it shows man his abject finitude, his physicalness, the likely unreality of his hopes and dreams. But even more immediately, it represents man’s utter bafflement at the sheer non-sense of creation: to fashion the sublime miracle of the human face, the mysterium tremendum of radiant feminine beauty, the veritable goddesses that beautiful women are; to bring this out of nothing, out of the void, and make it shine in noonday; to take such a miracle and put miracles again within it, deep in the mystery of eyes that peer out—the eye that gave even the dry Darwin a chill: to do all this, and to combine it with an anus that shits! It is too much. Nature mocks us, and poets live in torture.
</li><li>This is why it is so difficult to have sex without guilt: guilt is there because the body casts a shadow on the person’s inner freedom, his “real self” that—through the act of sex—is being forced into a standardized, mechanical, biological role. Even worse, the inner self is not even being called into consideration at all; the body takes over completely for the total person, and this kind of guilt makes the inner self shrink and threaten to disappear.
</li><li>Take stock of those around you and you will… hear them talk in precise terms about themselves and their surroundings, which would seem to point to them having ideas on the matter. But start to analyse those ideas and you will find that they hardly reflect in any way the reality to which they appear to refer, and if you go deeper you will discover that there is not even an attempt to adjust the ideas to this reality. Quite the contrary: through these notions the individual is trying to cut off any personal vision of reality, of his own very life. For life is at the start a chaos in which one is lost. The individual suspects this, but he is frightened at finding himself face to face with this terrible reality, and tries to cover it over with a curtain of fantasy, where everything is clear. It does not worry him that his “ideas” are not true, he uses them as trenches for the defense of his existence, as scarecrows to frighten away reality.
</li><li>Kierkegaard’s whole understanding of man’s character is that it is a structure built up to avoid perception of the “terror, perdition [and] annihilation [that] dwell next door to every man.”
</li><li>As Rank unfolded in book after book, and as Brown has recently again argued, the new perspective on psychoanalysis is that its crucial concept is the repression of death.6 This is what is creaturely about man, this is the repression on which culture is built, a repression unique to the self-conscious animal.
</li><li>Rank: “the death fear of the ego is lessened by the killing, the sacrifice, of the other; through the death of the other, one buys oneself free from the penalty of dying, of being killed.”
</li><li>Or as Fenichel later put it, people have a “longing for being hypnotized” precisely because they want to get back to the magical protection, the participation in omnipotence, the “oceanic feeling” that they enjoyed when they were loved and protected by their parents.16 And so, as Freud argues, it is not that groups bring out anything new in people; it is just that they satisfy the deep-seated erotic longings that people constantly carry around unconsciously.
</li><li>For Erich Fromm transference reflects man’s alienation: In order to overcome his sense of inner emptiness and impotence, [man]… chooses an object onto whom he projects all his own human qualities: his love, intelligence, courage, etc. By submitting to this object, he feels in touch with his own qualities; he feels strong, wise, courageous, and secure. To lose the object means the danger of losing himself. This mechanism, idolatric worship of an object, based on the fact of the individual’s alienation, is the central dynamism of transference, that which gives transference its strength and intensity.
</li><li>Rank said: “For only by living in close union with a god-ideal that has been erected outside one’s own ego is one able to live at all.”
</li><li>But Rank understood that the idea of God has never been a simple reflex of superstitious and selfish fear, as cynics and “realists” have claimed. Instead it is an outgrowth of genuine life-longing, a reaching-out for a plenitude of meaning—as James taught us.57 It seems that the yielding element in heroic belongingness is inherent in the life force itself, one of the truly sublime mysteries of created life. It seems that the life force reaches naturally even beyond the earth itself, which is one reason why man has always placed God in the heavens.
</li><li>Now we see what we might call the ontological or creature tragedy that is so peculiar to man: If he gives in to Agape he risks failing to develop himself, his active contribution to the rest of life. If he expands Eros too much he risks cutting himself off from natural dependency, from duty to a larger creation; he pulls away from the healing power of gratitude and humility that he must naturally feel for having been created, for having been given the opportunity of life experience.
</li><li>With the complex codes for sexual self-denial, man was able to impose the cultural map for personal immortality over the animal body. He brought sexual taboos into being because he needed to triumph over the body, and he sacrificed the pleasures of the body to the highest pleasure of all: self-perpetuation as a spiritual being through all eternity.
</li><li>We cannot repeat too often the great lesson of Freudian psychology: that repression is normal self-protection and creative self-restriction—in a real sense, man’s natural substitute for instinct. Rank has a perfect, key term for this natural human talent: he calls it “partialization” and very rightly sees that life is impossible without it. What we call the well-adjusted man has just this capacity to partialize the world for comfortable action.
</li><li>We can say that the essence of normality is the refusal of reality.3 What we call neurosis enters precisely at this point: Some people have more trouble with their lies than others. The world is too much with them, and the techniques that they have developed for holding it at bay and cutting it down to size finally begin to choke the person himself. This is neurosis in a nutshell: the miscarriage of clumsy lies about reality.
</li><li>Schizophrenia takes the risk of evolution to its furthest point in man: the risk of creating an animal who perceives himself, reflects on himself, and comes to understand that his animal body is a menace to himself.
</li><li>For such a one, apparently, homosexuality has nothing to do with the sex organs of the beloved but rather represents a struggle to create one’s own rebirth in the “closest possible likeness,” which, as Rank says, is obviously to be found in one’s own sex.
</li><li>As James said, each person sums up a whole range of very personal experiences so that his life is a very unique problem needing very individual kinds of solutions.
</li><li>Norman Brown’s Life Against Death:
</li><li>repression is not falsification of the world, it is “truth”—the only truth that man can know, because he cannot experience everything.

</h4><ul><li>The temperature plunged to minus 50, cold enough to freeze exposed flesh straight through in minutes.
</li><li>After my trip to Cholatse, I came to think of high-altitude climbing not so much as a sport but as a kind of art or even, in its purest form, rugged spirituality—a modern version of secular asceticism that purifies the soul by stripping away worldly comfort and convenience while forcing you to stare across the threshold of mortality. It is our effort to toil through these hazardous and inhospitable landscapes that culminates with such potent effect, what humanistic psychologists have described as the attainment of self-actualization, a pinnacle of personal expression that dissolves the constraints of our ordinary lives and allows us, even if fleetingly, to “become what we are capable of becoming.”
</li><li>During his twelve-year tenure on the hill, Brice had put more than 270 people on the summits of 8,000-meter peaks, more than any other single outfitter.
</li><li>“The real problems aren’t the obvious ones—the oxygen, that sort of thing,” Brice said. “It’s the not-so-obvious stuff that is making these people so weak. They haven’t been eating well because they haven’t been on an expedition with a budget to afford proper food. They’re always cold. They don’t have any support—no Sherpas, no guides. These are the things that are killing people. It’s out of control.”
</li><li>“About the height of 25,000 ft. the condition of stupefaction which ensues is extraordinary,” he wrote. “The mind and the body weaken by degrees, and imperceptibly, without consciousness of it. No suffering is then experienced; on the contrary, an inner joy is felt like an irradiation from the surrounding flood of light. One becomes indifferent. One thinks no more of the perilous position or of danger. One ascends, and is happy to ascend. The vertigo of the upper regions is not an idle word; but, so far as I can judge from my personal impression, vertigo appears at the last moment; it immediately precedes annihilation, sudden, unexpected, and irresistible.”
</li><li>What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy. And joy is, after all, the end of life. We do not live to eat and make money. We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life.
</li><li>When Mallory’s body was discovered seventy-five years later, during the spring of 1999, by American Conrad Anker during the Mallory and Irvine Research Expedition, it seemed the question might be settled once and for all. The corpse was lying facedown below the ridge at 26,750 feet, nearly perfectly preserved in the sterile air, though the clothes were shredded, bleach-white limbs exposed, like those of a mannequin made of alabaster.
</li><li>Even the swastika, the emblematic “hooked cross” of Nazi infamy, originated in southeastern Asia as a symbol of good luck.
</li><li>On June 5, the day the team reached its high point at around 25,500 feet on the North Face and finally called it quits, they were moving at less than 100 vertical feet per hour. Several weeks later, while Sayre was recuperating at the hospital in Kathmandu, he learned that he had contracted amoebic dysentery, cracked a rib, badly bruised one arm, and lost thirty pounds during the course of the trip.
</li><li>Climbers came to the north side for several reasons. Least tangible but hardly irrelevant was the opportunity to ascend a classic route with a storied history, following the hobnailed bootsteps of George Mallory, Sandy Irvine, and other Everest pioneers. Climbing from the north also took the south side’s Khumbu Icefall—a lethal maze of man-eating crevasses and teetering seracs—completely out of play. But the single most appealing aspect of climbing this side of the mountain was undoubtedly the price. The Chinese charged about $25,000 per team; authorities in Nepal charged $70,000.

</li><li>The body compensates for low-oxygen environments by ramping up red-blood-cell production, a process that kicks in even at the modest altitude of, say, Denver, Colorado, elevation 5,280 feet. At extreme altitudes, like 16,000-foot Everest Base Camp and above, the process intensifies until the blood is so thick it courses like sludge. The increased viscosity can lead to heart attacks, strokes, and pulmonary and cerebral edema. To help thin their blood, mountaineers hydrate obsessively, and some munch aspirin as if they’re Altoids.
</li><li>Even with unlimited time, few Westerners would ever fully acclimatize at ABC. You expend so much energy staying warm, fueling your muscles, and maintaining your basic body functions that it’s difficult, if not impossible, to regain your metabolic equilibrium. At this altitude, your body begins to eat itself, first burning up whatever glucose your blood can provide, then gnawing away on protein—muscle tissue—which is more easily converted to energy than fat is. As your appetite dwindles, you lose weight, slowly and reliably, but remain strangely flabby. The running joke about an Everest fat farm concludes with the same sad punch line: You’ll still have to exercise and diet when you get back to sea level.
</li><li>Down is deadly, as most climbers know. Eighty percent of Everest fatalities have occurred during the descent. There are a few obvious reasons. Your balance is off and the footholds precarious, sloping away, unexpectedly fragile, primed for a slip. Worse, you face away from the mountain, forced to stare at the terrifying emptiness below. Particularly debilitating is the energy crash. As adrenaline—more technically, the hormone epinephrine—wanes, fatigue and disorientation come crashing down like a wave set. Plenty of climbers have plunged to their deaths on Everest, but dozens of others have simply sat down and faded away.
</li><li>The year before, Brice had turned back an older Japanese client under eerily similar circumstances, in the same location, when his climber was moving too slowly and running out of oxygen. What Brice couldn’t know then was what would happen two years later, during the spring of 2007, when the same climber again attempted to climb the Northeast Ridge, this time with another team. At the Second Step, according to witnesses, he began to show signs of cerebral edema but insisted that he be allowed to continue up, despite the protests of his Sherpa and the expedition leader. At the summit, he reportedly went mad, throwing his gloves over the edge and clubbing himself in the head with his ice ax. His Sherpa managed to force him down a few hundred feet before he collapsed in the snow, where he could not be revived.

In about four billion years, Earth’s surface will become so hot that it will melt. In seven or eight billion years, the sun will be a red giant star, and it will expand until eventually our planet will be sucked into it, and any remaining Earthly evidence of what we thought or said or did will be absorbed into a burning sphere of plasma.
</li><li>Two hundred and fifty million years ago, during the Permian extinction, ocean surface waters likely reached 104 degrees Fahrenheit, or 40 degrees Celsius. Ninety-five percent of Earth’s species went extinct, and for five million years afterward, Earth was a “dead zone” with little expansion of life.
</li><li>Sixty-six million years ago, an asteroid impact caused a dust cloud so huge that darkness may have pervaded Earth for two years, virtually stopping photosynthesis and leading to the extinction of 75 percent of land animals.
</li><li>Earth is around 4.5 billion years old, a timescale I simply cannot get my head around. Instead, let’s imagine Earth’s history as a calendar year, with the formation of Earth being January 1, and today being December 31 at 11:59 PM. The first life on Earth emerges around February 25. Photosynthetic organisms first appear in late March. Multicellular life doesn’t appear until August or September. The first dinosaurs like eoraptor show up about 230 million years ago, or December 13 in our calendar year. The meteor impact that heralds the end of the dinosaurs happens around December 26. Homo sapiens aren’t part of the story until December 31 at 11:48 PM.
</li><li>For starters, velociraptors did not live in what is now Montana; they lived in what is now Mongolia and China, hence the scientific name, Velociraptor mongoliensis. While they were smart for dinosaurs, they were not smarter than dolphins or primates; they were probably closer to chickens or possums. And they were not six feet tall; they were about the size of a contemporary turkey, but with a long tail that could stretch for over three feet. They are estimated to have weighed less than thirty-five pounds, so it’s difficult to imagine one killing a human. In fact, they were probably mostly scavengers, eating meat from already dead carcasses.
</li><li>By 1950, 40 percent of Staphylococcus aureus samples in hospitals were resistant to penicillin; by 1960, 80 percent. Today, only around 2 percent of Staphylococcus aureus infections are sensitive to penicillin.
</li><li>In the winter of 2001, I had the foreknowledge that no remedy would come, and it was agonizing. I became unable to eat food, so instead I was drinking two two-liter bottles of Sprite per day, which is approximately the right number of calories to consume but not an ideal nutrition strategy.
</li><li>There are around 163,000 square kilometers of lawn in the U.S., greater than the size of Ohio, or the entire nation of Italy. Almost one-third of all residential water use in the U.S.—clean, drinkable water—is dedicated to lawns.

</h4><ul><li>Girard discovered that most of what we desire is mimetic (mi-met-ik) or imitative, not intrinsic. Humans learn—through imitation—to want the same things other people want, just as they learn how to speak the same language and play by the same cultural rules. Imitation plays a far more pervasive role in our society than anyone had ever openly acknowledged.
</li><li>Neither Tony nor I knew at the time how volatile 2008 would turn out to be. At the start of the year, Zappos had exceeded its operating profit goals and decided to award all of its employees generous bonuses. By the end of the year—only eight months after the bonuses were doled out—Zappos would have to lay off 8 percent of its workforce.

</li><li>We can never know what to want, because, living only one life, we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come. —Milan Kundera
</li><li>Mirror neurons were discovered accidentally, in Parma, Italy, in the 1990s, by a group of Italian scientists led by prominent neuroscientist Giacomo Rizzolatti. They discovered that a specific area of a macaque monkey’s brain activates when it sees an adult pick up a peanut—the same area that lights up if the monkey picks up a peanut directly. “That’s why it’s called a mirror neuron,” writes Marco Iacoboni, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “It’s almost like the monkey is watching his own action reflected by the mirror.”
</li><li>The moment a person exempts themselves in their own mind from the very thing they see all around them is the moment when they are most vulnerable.
</li><li>It’s as if everyone is saying, “Imitate me—but not too much,” because while everyone’s flattered by imitation, being copied too closely feels threatening.
</li><li>This brings us to an important feature of Celebristan models: because there’s no threat of conflict, they are generally imitated freely and openly.
</li><li>There’s psychological safety in mobs, just as there are in firing squads. “Can’t be sure that I’m responsible” is always a good defense—at least to oneself.
</li><li>One approach I recommend for uncovering thick desires—the one I’ll focus on here—involves taking the time to listen to the most deeply fulfilling experiences of your colleagues’ (or partners’, or friends’, or classmates’) lives, and sharing your own with them. The more we understand one another’s stories of meaningful achievement, the more effectively we understand how to work with each other: what moves and motivates others, what gives them satisfaction in their work.
</li><li>Many books have been written about improving one’s ability to discern well. Here is a distillation of some key points: (1) pay attention to the interior movements of the heart when contemplating different desires—which give a fleeting feeling of satisfaction and which give satisfaction that endures? (2) ask yourself which desire is more generous and loving; (3) put yourself on your deathbed in your mind’s eye and ask yourself which desire you would be more at peace with having followed; (4) finally, and most importantly, ask yourself where a given desire comes from.
</li><li>In my experience, the most effective context for discerning desires is a silent retreat—ideally, at least five days (but a minimum of three) of being unplugged from all noise and screens, in a remote location, completely off the grid. No talking allowed.
</li><li>Ian Pearson, another well-known futurist, has an idea. He predicts that humans will be having more sex with robots than with each other by 2050.
</li><li>The question “What do we want to want?” is unsettling partly because, in a world of engineered desires, we have to wonder who is doing the engineering. But also because the question implies that it’s possible to want to want something, yet not be capable of wanting it. We cannot want what we lack a model for.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Monday, February 28, 2022 7:04:37 PM
</h4><ul><li>The eminent Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung said this: “People will do anything, no matter how absurd, to avoid facing their own souls.” But he also said this: “Who looks inside, awakes.”
</li><li>During my training, a supervisor once told me, “There’s something likable in everyone,” and to my great surprise, I found that she was right. It’s impossible to get to know people deeply and not come to like them. We should take the world’s enemies, get them in a room to share their histories and formative experiences, their fears and their struggles, and global adversaries would suddenly get along. I’ve found something likable in literally everyone I’ve seen as a therapist, including the guy who attempted murder. (Beneath his rage, he turned out to be a real sweetheart.)
</li><li>As a therapist, I know a lot about pain, about the ways in which pain is tied to loss. But I also know something less commonly understood: that change and loss travel together. We can’t have change without loss, which is why so often people say they want change but nonetheless stay exactly the same.
</li><li>A little-discussed fact: Therapists go to therapists.
</li><li>One of the most important steps in therapy is helping people take responsibility for their current predicaments, because once they realize that they can (and must) construct their own lives, they’re free to generate change.
</li><li>“If the queen had balls, she’d be the king.”
</li><li>To avoid an ethical breach known as a dual relationship, I can’t treat or receive treatment from any person in my orbit—not a parent of a kid in my son’s class, not the sister of my coworker, not a friend’s mom, not my neighbor. The relationship in the therapy room needs to be its own, distinct and apart. These rules don’t hold for other health-care clinicians. You can play tennis or be in a book club with your surgeon, dermatologist, or chiropractor, but not with your therapist.
</li><li>He knows what all therapists know: That the presenting problem, the issue somebody comes in with, is often just one aspect of a larger problem, if not a red herring entirely. He knows that most people are brilliant at finding ways to filter out the things they don’t want to look at, at using distractions or defenses to keep threatening feelings at bay. He knows that pushing aside emotions only makes them stronger, but that before he goes in and destroys somebody’s defense—whether that defense is obsessing about another person or pretending not to see what’s in plain sight—he needs to help the patient replace the defense with something else so that he doesn’t leave the person raw and exposed with no protection whatsoever. As the term implies, defenses serve a useful purpose. They shield people from injury . . . until they no longer need them.
</li><li>Above all, I didn’t want to fall into the trap that Buddhists call idiot compassion—an apt phrase, given John’s worldview. In idiot compassion, you avoid rocking the boat to spare people’s feelings, even though the boat needs rocking and your compassion ends up being more harmful than your honesty. People do this with teenagers, spouses, addicts, even themselves. Its opposite is wise compassion, which means caring about the person but also giving him or her a loving truth bomb when needed.
</li><li>“There’s a difference between pain and suffering,” Wendell says. “You’re going to have to feel pain—everyone feels pain at times—but you don’t have to suffer so much. You’re not choosing the pain, but you’re choosing the suffering.”
</li><li>I know, for example, that people who are demanding, critical, and angry tend to suffer from intense loneliness. I know that a person who acts this way both wants to be seen and is terrified of being seen.
</li><li>Rather than steering people straight to the heart of the problem, we nudge them to arrive there on their own, because the most powerful truths—the ones people take the most seriously—are those they come to, little by little, on their own.
</li><li>It may seem counterintuitive, but therapy works best when people start getting better—when they feel less depressed or anxious, or the crisis has passed. Now they’re less reactive, more present, more able to engage in the work. Unfortunately, sometimes people leave just as their symptoms lift, not realizing (or perhaps knowing all too well) that the work is just beginning and that staying will require them to work even harder.
</li><li>The therapist explained that often different parts of ourselves want different things, and if we silence the parts we find unacceptable, they’ll find other ways to be heard.
</li><li>Anger is the go-to feeling for most people because it’s outward-directed—angrily blaming others can feel deliciously sanctimonious. But often it’s only the tip of the iceberg, and if you look beneath the surface, you’ll glimpse submerged feelings you either weren’t aware of or didn’t want to show: fear, helplessness, envy, loneliness, insecurity. And if you can tolerate these deeper feelings long enough to understand them and listen to what they’re telling you, you’ll not only manage your anger in more productive ways, you also won’t be so angry all the time.
</li><li>Of course, anger serves another function—it pushes people away and keeps them from getting close enough to see you. I wonder if John needs people to be angry at him so that they won’t see his sadness.
</li><li>remember a quote from Einstein: “No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.”
</li><li>Even her movements were listless, like the way she sauntered to the sofa in slow motion, a sign of depression known as psychomotor retardation. (This slowing down of coordinated efforts between the brain and the body might also explain why I kept missing the tissue box in Wendell’s office.)
</li><li>As Andrew Solomon wrote in The Noonday Demon: “The opposite of depression isn’t happiness, but vitality.”
</li><li>In movies, therapist silences have become a cliché, but it’s only in silence that people can truly hear themselves. Talking can keep people in their heads and safely away from their emotions. Being silent is like emptying the trash. When you stop tossing junk into the void—words, words, and more words—something important rises to the surface. And when the silence is a shared experience, it can be a gold mine for thoughts and feelings that the patient didn’t even know existed. It’s no wonder that I spent an entire session with Wendell saying virtually nothing and simply crying. Even great joy is sometimes best expressed through silence, as when a patient comes in after landing a hard-won promotion or getting engaged and can’t find the words to express the magnitude of what she’s feeling. So we sit in silence together, beaming.
</li><li>What most people mean by type is a sense of attraction—a type of physical appearance or a type of personality turns them on. But what underlies a person’s type, in fact, is a sense of familiarity. It’s no coincidence that people who had angry parents often end up choosing angry partners, that those with alcoholic parents are frequently drawn to partners who drink quite a bit, or that those who had withdrawn or critical parents find themselves married to spouses who are withdrawn or critical.
</li><li>He thought I was a modern-day version of Freud’s female hysteric, experiencing what’s known as conversion disorder. This is a condition in which a person’s anxiety is “converted” into neurologic conditions such as paralysis, balance issues, incontinence, blindness, deafness, tremors, or seizures. The symptoms are often temporary and tend to be related (sometimes symbolically) to the psychological stressor at its root. For instance, after seeing something traumatic (like one’s spouse in bed with another person or a grisly murder), a patient might experience blindness. After a terrifying fall, a patient might experience leg paralysis even though there was no functional evidence of nerve damage. Or a man who feels that his anger toward his wife is unacceptable might experience numbness in the arm he fantasized about raising to hit her.
</li><li>Sometimes “drama,” no matter how unpleasant, can be a form of self-medication, a way to calm ourselves down by avoiding the crises brewing inside.
</li><li>Taped up next to my files is the word ultracrepidarianism, which means “the habit of giving opinions and advice on matters outside of one’s knowledge or competence.”
</li><li>Charlotte generally betrays little, if any, real emotion—her face is a mask, her words, diversions. It’s not that she’s hiding her feelings; it’s that she can’t access them. There’s a word for this kind of emotional blindness: alexithymia. She doesn’t know what she’s feeling or doesn’t have the words to express it.
</li><li>Almost every woman I see apologizes for her feelings, especially her tears. I remember apologizing in Wendell’s office too. Perhaps men apologize preemptively, by holding their tears back.
</li><li>“You’ll turn thirty or forty or fifty anyway, whether your hours are finished or not,” she said. “What does it matter what age you are when that happens? Either way, you won’t get today back.”
</li><li>I try to wrap my mind around this paradox: self-sabotage as a form of control. If I screw up my life, I can engineer my own death rather than have it happen to me. If I stay in a doomed relationship, if I mess up my career, if I hide in fear instead of facing what’s wrong with my body, I can create a living death—but one where I call the shots.
</li><li>But I don’t say that right now. I can tell that John’s feeling what therapists call flooded, meaning that his nervous system is in overdrive, and when people feel flooded, it’s best to wait a beat. We do this with couples when one person is so overwhelmed by anger or hurt that all he can do is lash out or shut down. The person needs a few minutes for his nervous system to reset before he can take anything in.
</li><li>He was in his thirties when World War II broke out, putting him, a Jew, in jeopardy. Offered immigration to the United States, he turned it down so as not to abandon his parents, and a year later, the Nazis forced Frankl and his wife to have her pregnancy terminated. In a matter of months, he and other family members were deported to concentration camps, and when Frankl was finally freed, three years later, he learned that the Nazis had killed his wife, his brother, and both of his parents.
</li><li>“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances.”
</li><li>She was used to viewing the world from a place of deficit, and as a result, joy felt foreign to her. If you’re used to feeling abandoned, if you already know what it’s like for people to disappoint or reject you—well, it may not feel good, but at least there are no surprises; you know the customs in your own homeland. Once you step into foreign territory, though—if you spend time with reliable people who find you appealing and interesting—you might feel anxious and disoriented. All of a sudden, nothing’s familiar. You have no landmarks, nothing to go by, and all of the predictability of the world you’re used to is gone. The place you came from may not be great—it might, in fact, be pretty awful—but you knew exactly what you’d get there (disappointment, chaos, isolation, criticism).
</li><li>There’s a term we use in therapy: forced forgiveness. Sometimes people feel that in order to get past a trauma, they need to forgive whoever caused the damage—the parent who sexually assaulted them, the burglar who robbed their house, the gang member who killed their son. They’re told by well-meaning people that until they can forgive, they’ll hold on to the anger. Granted, for some, forgiveness can serve as a powerful release—you forgive the person who wronged you, without condoning his actions, and it allows you to move on. But too often people feel pressured to forgive and then end up believing that something’s wrong with them if they can’t quite get there—that they aren’t enlightened enough or strong enough or compassionate enough. So what I say is this: You can have compassion without forgiving. There are many ways to move on, and pretending to feel a certain way isn’t one of them.
</li><li>A flight to health is a phenomenon in which patients convince themselves that they’re suddenly over their issues because, unbeknownst to them, they can’t tolerate the anxiety that working through these issues is bringing up.
</li><li>Typically, a patient might have a difficult session about a childhood trauma, then come in the next week and announce that therapy is no longer needed. I feel great! That session was cathartic! A flight to health is especially common when the therapist or patient has been away and in that break, the person’s unconscious defenses take hold. I did so well the past few weeks. I don’t think I need therapy anymore! Sometimes this change is genuine. Other times, patients abruptly leave—only to come back.
</li><li>Sometimes what seems like setting a boundary—saying no—is actually a cop-out, an inverted way of avoiding saying yes.
</li><li>But Wendell told me that by diminishing my problems, I was judging myself and everyone else whose problems I had placed lower down on the hierarchy of pain. You can’t get through your pain by diminishing it, he reminded me. You get through your pain by accepting it and figuring out what to do with it. You can’t change what you’re denying or minimizing. And, of course, often what seem like trivial worries are manifestations of deeper ones.
</li><li>This strategy, in which the therapist instructs patients not to do what they’re already not doing, is called a paradoxical intervention. Given the ethical considerations involved, a therapist has to be well trained on how and when to use paradoxical directives, but the idea behind them is that if patients believe that a behavior or symptom is beyond their control, then making it voluntary, something they can choose whether or not to do, calls that belief into question. Once patients realize that they’re choosing a behavior, they can examine the secondary gains—the unconscious benefits it offers (avoidance, rebellion, a cry for help).
</li><li>I was thinking about an observation made at the end of that segment—that we’re all time-traveling into the future and at exactly the same rate: sixty minutes per hour.
</li><li>In reaction formation, unacceptable feelings or impulses are expressed as their opposite, as when a person who dislikes her neighbor goes out of her way to befriend her or when an evangelical Christian man who’s attracted to men makes homophobic slurs.
</li><li>“Almost is always the hardest, isn’t it?” she said one afternoon. “Almost getting something. Almost having a baby. Almost getting a clean scan. Almost not having cancer anymore.” I thought about how many people avoid trying for things they really want in life because it’s more painful to get close to the goal but not achieve it than not to have taken the chance in the first place.
</li><li>We didn’t have a profound “grand finale,” as Julie had been calling our final session. Her last words to me were about steak. “God, what I would give for a steak!” she said, her voice weak and barely audible. “They better have steak wherever I’m going.” And then she fell asleep. It was an ending not unlike our sessions, where even though “our time is up,” the conversation lingers. In the best goodbyes, there’s always the feeling that there’s something more to say.
</li><li>There’s a biblical saying that translates roughly as “First you will do, then you will understand.” Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith and experience something before its meaning becomes apparent.
</li><li>But we’re also taught something else that we can’t really understand until we’ve done thousands of hours of sessions: We grow in connection with others. Everyone needs to hear that other person’s voice saying, I believe in you. I can see possibilities that you might not see quite yet. I imagine that something different can happen, in some form or another. In therapy we say, Let’s edit your story.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Sunday, March 6, 2022 1:20:34 PM
</h4><ul><li>He retorts that being a servant is actually the perfect profession for a philosopher: It’s quiet. It’s easy. It lets him study people. It gives him time to think. It is an opportunity, like any other job, for excellence and mastery.
</li><li>Marcus knew the history of his school quite well. And he knew that all dogmatic disputes come to naught in the end. It all disappears. It becomes dust or legend, or less than that. Quotations of quotations from books that were lost to time. All that remains, Aristo would have said, is how we lived our lives, how close we came to virtue in the moments that mattered.
</li><li>It’s not that Chrysippus forsook all pleasures and all money; it’s that he was suspicious of wanting, lusting for anything. A wise man can make use of whatever comes his way, he said, but is in want of nothing. “On the other hand,” he said, “nothing is needed by the fool for he does not understand how to use anything but he is in want of everything.” There is no better definition of a Stoic: to have but not want, to enjoy without needing.
</li><li>One of the central beliefs of Stoicism is the idea that history is cyclical. That the same thing happens again and again and again. We are not so special, they would say. We are interchangeable pieces, role players in a play that has been playing since the beginning of time.
</li><li>Antipater not only took it further, but proposed that ethical behavior—or even sportsmanship—was itself a kind of craft that required real work and effort. For him, the human being in action is better understood as an archer. We train and practice. We draw back the arrow and aim it to the best of our abilities. But we know full well that despite our training and our aim, many factors outside our control will influence where the arrow hits the target—or if it falls short entirely. This is what the pursuit of virtue is in real life. We study. We train until things become second nature. The moment arrives. We commit. We hold up what’s right as our target. We take action. But much happens after that—much of it not remotely up to us. Which is why we know that our true worth doesn’t reside in whether or not we get a bull’s-eye. In the real world, we miss. Sometimes by a lot. But we have to keep trying. The more we work on it the better we get. The more shots we take, the more times we’ll hit the target and the more good we’ll do.
</li><li>We naturally care what people think of us; we don’t want to seem too different, so we acquire the same tastes as everyone else. We accept what the crowd does so the crowd will accept us. But in doing this, we weaken ourselves. We compromise, often without knowing it; we allow ourselves to be bought—without even the benefit of getting paid for it.
</li><li>According to Agrippinus, we are all threads in a garment—which means that most people are indistinguishable from each other, one thread among countless others. Most people were happy conforming, being anonymous, handling their own tiny, unsung role in the fabric. Who can blame them? Under a tyrant, the best strategy is usually to keep a low profile, to blend in so one does not catch the attention of the capricious and cruel ruler who holds the power of life and death. But to Agrippinus, even having lost his father under such circumstances, this kind of compromise was inconceivable. “I want to be the red,” he said, “that small and brilliant portion which causes the rest to appear comely and beautiful. . . . ‘Be like the majority of people?’ And if I do that, how shall I any longer be the red?”
</li><li>Most interestingly, he quibbled with the idea that death was something that lay ahead of us in the uncertain future. “This is our big mistake,” Seneca wrote, “to think we look forward toward death. Most of death is already gone. Whatever time has passed is owned by death.” That was what he realized, that we are dying every day and no day, once dead, can be revived.
</li><li>But what of all the comforts he was deprived of? Musonius chose to think about what he still had access to—the sun, water, air. When he missed the amenities of Rome, friends, or the freedom to travel, he reminded himself and his fellow exiles that “when we were home, we did not enjoy the whole earth, nor did we have contact with all men.” And then he got back to spending his time in Gyara doing what he did best—finding opportunities to do good.
</li><li>To Epictetus, no human was the full author of what happened in life. Instead, he said, it was as if we were in a play, and if it was the playwright’s “pleasure you should act a poor man, a cripple, a governor, or a private person, see that you act it naturally. For this is your business, to act well the character assigned you; to choose it is another’s.”
</li><li>Epictetus was reminded daily how little control he had, even of his own person. As he came to study and understand Stoicism, he adopted this lesson into what he described as our “chief task in life.” It was, he said, simply “to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control.”
</li><li>Once we have organized our understanding of the world into this stark categorization, what remains—what was so central to Epictetus’s survival as a slave—is to focus on what is up to us. Our attitudes. Our emotions. Our wants. Our desires. Our opinions about what has happened to us. Epictetus believed that as powerless as humans were over their external conditions, they always retained the ability to choose how they responded. “You can bind up my leg,” he would say—indeed, his leg really had been bound and broken—“but not even Zeus has the power to break my freedom of choice.”
</li><li>If a person wants to be happy, wants to feel fairly treated, wants to be rich, according to Epictetus, they don’t need life to be easy, people to be nice, and money to flow freely. They need to look at the world right. “It’s not things that upset us,” he would say, “it’s our judgment about things.” Our opinions determine the reality we experience. Epictetus didn’t believe it was possible to be offended or frustrated, not without anyone’s consent. “Remember, it is not enough to be hit or insulted to be harmed, you must believe that you are being harmed,” he said. “If someone succeeds in provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation. Which is why it is essential that we not respond impulsively to impressions; take a moment before reacting, and you will find it easier to maintain control.”
</li><li>Persist and resist. The ingredients of freedom, whatever one’s condition.
</li><li>Forget everything but action. Don’t talk about it, be about it. “Don’t explain your philosophy,” Epictetus said, “embody it.”
</li><li>You owe it to yourself and to the world to actively engage with the brief moment you have on this planet. You cannot retreat exclusively into ideas. You must contribute.
</li><li>At the core of Marcus Aurelius’s power as a philosopher and a philosopher king seems to be a pretty simple exercise that he must have read about in Seneca’s writings and then in Epictetus’s: the morning or evening review. “Every day and night keep thoughts like these at hand,” Epictetus had said. “Write them, read them aloud, talk to yourself and others about them.”

</h4><ul><li>But I find early morning a wondrous time for formal meditation. No one else is up. The world’s rush hasn’t launched itself yet. I get out of bed and usually devote about an hour to being, without doing anything. After twenty-eight years, it hasn’t lost its allure. On occasion it is difficult to wake up and either my mind or my body resists. But part of the value is in doing it anyway, even if I don’t feel like it.
</li><li>“What is it on this planet [which he referred to as Spaceship Earth] that needs doing that I know something about, that probably won’t happen unless I take responsibility for it?”
</li><li>“What is my job on the planet with a capital J?”, or, “What do I care about so much that I would pay to do it?” If I ask such a question and I don’t come up with an answer, other than, “I don’t know,” then I just keep asking the question. If you start reflecting on such questions when you’re in your twenties, by the time you are thirty-five or forty, or fifty or sixty, the inquiry itself may have led you a few places that you would not have gone had you merely followed mainstream conventions, or your parents’ expectations for you, or even worse, your own unexamined self-limiting beliefs and expectations.
</li><li>A friend came back after several years in Nepal and India in 1973 and said of himself, “If I can’t do anything useful, at least I would like to do as little harm as possible.”
</li><li>Perhaps ultimately, spiritual simply means experiencing wholeness and interconnectedness directly, a seeing that individuality and the totality are interwoven, that nothing is separate or extraneous. If you see in this way, then everything becomes spiritual in its deepest sense. Doing science is spiritual. So is washing the dishes. It is the inner experience which counts. And you have to be there for it. All else is mere thinking.
</li><li>Zen practitioners have the wholly irreverent and wonderfully provocative saying, “If you meet the Buddha, kill him,” which means that any conceptual attachments to Buddha or enlightenment are far from the mark.

</h4><ul><li>"Stop scolding, dear friend! Nothing was ever achieved by scolding. If a loss has occurred, let me bear that loss.
</li><li>This was among the ferryman's virtues one of the greatest: like only a few, he knew how to listen. Without him having spoken a word, the speaker sensed how Vasudeva let his words enter his mind, quiet, open, waiting, how he did not lose a single one, awaited not a single one with impatience, did not add his praise or rebuke, was just listening. Siddhartha felt, what a happy fortune it is, to confess to such a listener, to bury in his heart his own life, his own search, his own suffering.
</li><li>"When someone is searching," said Siddhartha, "then it might easily happen that the only thing his eyes still see is that what he searches for, that he is unable to find anything, to let anything enter his mind, because he always thinks of nothing but the object of his search, because he has a goal, because he is obsessed by the goal. Searching means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal. You, oh venerable one, are perhaps indeed a searcher, because, striving for your goal, there are many things you don't see, which are directly in front of your eyes."
</li><li>Look, my dear Govinda, this is one of my thoughts, which I have found: wisdom cannot be passed on. Wisdom which a wise man tries to pass on to someone always sounds like foolishness."
</li><li>"Listen well, my dear, listen well! The sinner, which I am and which you are, is a sinner, but in times to come he will be Brahma again, he will reach the Nirvana, will be Buddha—and now see: these 'times to come' are a deception, are only a parable! The sinner is not on his way to become a Buddha, he is not in the process of developing, though our capacity for thinking does not know how else to picture these things. No, within the sinner is now and today already the future Buddha, his future is already all there, you have to worship in him, in you, in everyone the Buddha which is coming into being, the possible, the hidden Buddha. The world, my friend Govinda, is not imperfect, or on a slow path towards perfection: no, it is perfect in every moment, all sin already carries the divine forgiveness in itself, all small children already have the old person in themselves, all infants already have death, all dying people the eternal life. It is not possible for any person to see how far another one has already progressed on his path; in the robber and dice-gambler, the Buddha is waiting; in the Brahman, the robber is waiting. In deep meditation, there is the possibility to put time out of existence, to see all life which was, is, and will be as if it was simultaneous, and there everything is good, everything is perfect, everything is Brahman. Therefore, I see whatever exists as good, death is to me like life, sin like holiness, wisdom like foolishness, everything has to be as it is, everything only requires my consent, only my willingness, my loving agreement, to be good for me, to do nothing but work for my benefit, to be unable to ever harm me. I have experienced on my body and on my soul that I needed sin very much, I needed lust, the desire for possessions, vanity, and needed the most shameful despair, in order to learn how to give up all resistance, in order to learn how to love the world, in order to stop comparing it to some world I wished, I imagined, some kind of perfection I had made up, but to leave it as it is and to love it and to enjoy being a part of it.—These, oh Govinda, are some of the thoughts which have come into my mind."

</h4><ul><li>What appears casual and nonchalant to the viewer is a scrupulously planned-out chain of events, laid out by someone who had turned his whole being to making his goal a reality.
</li><li>The Indian meditation master Atisha wrote, “All activities should be done with one intention.” That intention is a willingness to be kind to ourselves, and thus influence the world around us in a positive way.
</li><li>When we are confronted by someone requesting something from us, we can remember that generosity is a way to loosen our ego. In the words of Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, “Holding on to anything is a way of holding on to ourselves.”
</li><li>Patience from a Buddhist perspective is not a “wait and see” attitude, but rather one of “just be there.” It is something we can take joy in cultivating. When you are sitting on the meditation cushion, a strong emotion, such as fear, might come up. You begin to think, “What if my presentation does not go well tomorrow?” That fear begins to creep up on you, growing as your mind starts to spiral into a variety of scenarios based in fear. Applying patience in this scenario is just being present with the emotion, letting it ebb and flow like the tide, while returning to your breath as much as possible.
</li><li>Prajna is the quality of seeing a situation without painting your own projection onto it. It’s removing the “me”-ness from a problem in order to see the best solution. When your own ego is not involved in determining the best course of action, you have removed the largest hindrance from seeing a situation as it is.
</li><li>From a Buddhist standpoint, this ego is a fallacy. In the same way that we cannot irrefutably prove that there is a god or gods manipulating our existence, we cannot prove that we are a solid, set self.
</li><li>In some sense, the ego you create is a papier-mâché version of yourself. You have this body that you use as the core shell. From there, you layer on strips of personality, adding an interest in sports here, a favorite movie there, a funny facial tick on another side, and boom, you have created an ego doll.
</li><li>The Vajrayana path is based in looking at all the nitty-gritty parts of your life that you normally gloss over, and instead contemplating, “How can I express my innate wisdom here?” or “How can I express my basic enlightened qualities?” This means looking at the various aspects of your life that you might normally consider vices, and instead looking to them as opportunities to practice meditative mind.
</li><li>There is an old Buddhist joke: The Dalai Lama approaches a hot dog vendor. The hot dog vendor asks, “What’ll it be?” The Dalai Lama replies, “Make me one with everything.” One spin on this joke is that the Dalai Lama buys a hot dog and hands the man a ten-dollar bill. After a few moments, the Dalai Lama impatiently asks, “Where’s my change?” The hot dog vendor replies, “Buddy, change comes from within.”
</li><li>The world does not need to be altered or changed in order for it to be sacred. It already is sacred. Similarly, everyone around us has basic goodness and is sacred as well. They may act confused at times, but they are basically good. We don’t have to change anything about them, either.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Wednesday, March 16, 2022 2:42:08 AM
</h4><ul><li>There have always been literate ignoramuses who have read too widely and not well. The Greeks had a name for such a mixture of learning and folly which might be applied to the bookish but poorly read of all ages. They are all sophomores.
</li><li>If you ask a living teacher a question, he will probably answer you. If you are puzzled by what he says, you can save yourself the trouble of thinking by asking him what he means. If, however, you ask a book a question, you must answer it yourself. In this respect a book is like nature or the world. When you question it, it answers you only to the extent that you do the work of thinking and analysis yourself.
</li><li>It is astonishing how many people never even glance at a book’s table of contents unless they wish to look something up in it. In fact, many authors spend a considerable amount of time in creating the table of contents, and it is sad to think their efforts are often wasted.
</li><li>That rule is simply this: In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through without ever stopping to look up or ponder the things you do not understand right away.
</li><li>Every book, no matter how difficult, contains interstitial material that can be and should be read quickly; and every good book also contains matter that is difficult and should be read very slowly.
</li><li>Finally, do not try to understand every word or page of a difficult book the first time through. This is the most important rule of all; it is the essence of inspectional reading. Do not be afraid to be, or to seem to be, superficial. Race through even the hardest book. You will then be prepared to read it well the second time.
</li><li>The first rule of analytical reading can be expressed as follows: RULE 1. YOU MUST KNOW WHAT KIND OF BOOK YOU ARE READING, AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS AS EARLY IN THE PROCESS AS POSSIBLE, PREFERABLY BEFORE YOU BEGIN TO READ.
</li><li>If a theoretical book emphasizes things that lie outside the scope of your normal, routine, daily experience, it is a scientific work. If not, it is philosophical.
</li><li>RULE 2. STATE THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE BOOK IN A SINGLE SENTENCE, OR AT MOST A FEW SENTENCES (A SHORT PARAGRAPH).
</li><li>The reader who says, “I know what it is, but I just can’t say it,” probably does not even fool himself.
</li><li>RULE 3. SET FORTH THE MAJOR PARTS OF THE BOOK, AND SHOW HOW THESE ARE ORGANIZED INTO A WHOLE, BY BEING ORDERED TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO THE UNITY OF THE WHOLE.
</li><li>RULE 4. FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR’S PROBLEMS WERE.
</li><li>You must spot the important words in a book and figure out how the author is using them. But we can make that a little more precise and elegant: RULE 5. FIND THE IMPORTANT WORDS AND THROUGH THEM COME TO TERMS WITH THE AUTHOR. Note that the rule has two parts. The first part is to locate the important words, the words that make a difference. The second part is to determine the meaning of these words, as used, with precision.
</li><li>You can be sure of one thing. Not all the words an author uses are important. Better than that, you can be sure that most of his words are not. Only those words that he uses in a special way are important for him, and for us as readers.
</li><li>RULE 6. MARK THE MOST IMPORTANT SENTENCES IN A BOOK AND DISCOVER THE PROPOSITIONS THEY CONTAIN.
</li><li>RULE 7. LOCATE OR CONSTRUCT THE BASIC ARGUMENTS IN THE BOOK BY FINDING THEM IN THE CONNECTION OF SENTENCES.
</li><li>Perhaps you are beginning to see how essential a part of reading it is to be perplexed and know it. Wonder is the beginning of wisdom in learning from books as well as from nature. If you never ask yourself any questions about the meaning of a passage, you cannot expect the book to give you any insight you do not already possess.
</li><li>Many persons believe that they know how to read because they read at different speeds. But they pause and go slow over the wrong sentences. They pause over the sentences that interest them rather than the ones that puzzle them.
</li><li>If, when you are asked to explain what the author means by a particular sentence, all you can do is repeat his very words, with some minor alterations in their order, you had better suspect that you do not know what he means. Ideally, you should be able to say the same thing in totally different words. The idea can, of course, be approximated in varying degrees. But if you cannot get away at all from the author’s words, it shows that only words have passed from him to you, not thought or knowledge. You know his words, not his mind. He was trying to communicate knowledge, and all you received was words.
</li><li>There is one other test of whether you understand the proposition in a sentence you have read. Can you point to some experience you have had that the proposition describes or to which the proposition is in any way relevant? Can you exemplify the general truth that has been enunciated by referring to a particular instance of it? To imagine a possible case is often as good as citing an actual one.
</li><li>Because of all this, we suggest another formulation of RULE 7, as follows: FIND IF YOU CAN THE PARAGRAPHS IN A BOOK THAT STATE ITS IMPORTANT ARGUMENTS; BUT IF THE ARGUMENTS ARE NOT THUS EXPRESSED, YOUR TASK IS TO CONSTRUCT THEM, BY TAKING A SENTENCE FROM THIS PARAGRAPH, AND ONE FROM THAT, UNTIL YOU HAVE GATHERED TOGETHER THE SEQUENCE OF SENTENCES THAT STATE THE PROPOSITIONS THAT COMPOSE THE ARGUMENT.
</li><li>Which of the problems that the author tried to solve did he succeed in solving? In the course of solving these, did he raise any new ones? Of the problems that he failed to solve, old or new, which did the author himself know he had failed on?
</li><li>RULE 8. FIND OUT WHAT THE AUTHOR’S SOLUTIONS ARE.
</li><li>Reading a book is a kind of conversation. You may think it is not conversation at all, because the author does all the talking and you have nothing to say. If you think that, you do not realize your full obligation as a reader—and you are not grasping your opportunities.
</li><li>RULE 9. YOU MUST BE ABLE TO SAY, WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY, “I UNDERSTAND,” BEFORE YOU CAN SAY ANY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING THINGS: “I AGREE,” OR “I DISAGREE,” OR “I SUSPEND JUDGMENT.”
</li><li>It is RULE 10, and it can be expressed thus: WHEN YOU DISAGREE, DO SO REASONABLY, AND NOT DISPUTATIOUSLY OR CONTENTIOUSLY.
</li><li>RESPECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE AND MERE PERSONAL OPINION, BY GIVING REASONS FOR ANY CRITICAL JUDGMENT YOU MAKE.
</li><li>And seeking the meaning of a book that puzzles you in a commentary is often ill-advised. On the whole, it is best to do all that you can by yourself before seeking outside help; for if you act consistently on this principle, you will find that you need less and less outside help.
</li><li>Imaginative literature primarily pleases rather than teaches. It is much easier to be pleased than taught, but much harder to know why one is pleased. Beauty is harder to analyze than truth.
</li><li>Don’t try to resist the effect that a work of imaginative literature has on you.
</li><li>The kind of activity that is appropriate in reading poetry and fiction is not the same. It is a sort of passive action, if we may be allowed the expression, or, better, active passion. We must act in such a way, when reading a story, that we let it act on us. We must allow it to move us, we must let it do whatever work it wants to do on us. We must somehow make ourselves open to it.
</li><li>Don’t look for terms, propositions, and arguments in imaginative literature. Such things are logical, not poetic, devices. “In poetry and in drama,” the poet Mark Van Doren once observed, “statement is one of the obscurer mediums.” What a lyric poem “states,” for instance, cannot be found in any of its sentences. And the whole, comprising all its words in their relations to and reactions upon each other, says something that can never be confined within the straitjacket of propositions.
</li><li>The fictional analogue of the rule that directs you to find the author’s propositions can, therefore, be stated as follows: become at home in this imaginary world; know it as if you were an observer on the scene; become a member of its population, willing to befriend its characters, and able to participate in its happenings by sympathetic insight, as you would do in the actions and sufferings of a friend.
</li><li>Where, in the case of expository works, the advice was not to criticize a book—not to say you agree or disagree—until you can first say you understand, so here the maxim is: don’t criticize imaginative writing until you fully appreciate what the author has tried to make you experience.
</li><li>Hence, to complete the task of criticism, you must objectify your reactions by pointing to those things in the book that caused them. You must pass from saying what you like or dislike and why, to saying what is good or bad about the book and why.
</li><li>The first piece of advice we would like to give you for reading a story is this: Read it quickly and with total immersion. Ideally, a story should be read at one sitting, although this is rarely possible for busy people with long novels.
</li><li>A story is like life itself; in life, we do not expect to understand events as they occur, at least with total clarity, but looking back on them, we do understand. So the reader of a story, looking back on it after he has finished it, understands the relation of events and the order of actions.
</li><li>When you read a play, you are not reading a complete work. The complete play (the work that the author intended you to apprehend) is only apprehended when it is acted on a stage. Like music, which must be heard, a play lacks a physical dimension when we read it in a book. The reader must supply that dimension. The only way to do that is to make a pretense of seeing it acted.
</li><li>First, lyric poetry, even modern poetry, does not always demand as much work as you may think if you go about reading it in the right way. Second, it is often worth whatever effort you are willing to spend.
</li><li>A good poem can be worked at, re-read, and thought about over and over for the rest of your life. You will never stop finding new things in it, new pleasures and delights, and also new ideas about yourself and the world.
</li><li>The first rule to follow in reading a lyric is to read it through without stopping, whether you think you understand it or not.
</li><li>The second rule for reading lyrics is this: Read the poem through again—but read it out loud.
</li><li>A good historian does not, of course, make up the past. He considers himself responsibly bound by some concept or criterion of accuracy or facts. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that the historian must always make up something. He must either find a general pattern in, or impose one on, events; or he must suppose that he knows why the persons in his story did the things they did.
</li><li>The causes of every human action, Tolstoy thought, were so manifold, so complex, and so deeply hidden in unconscious motivations that it is impossible to know why anything ever happened.
</li><li>Because theories of history differ, and because a historian’s theory affects his account of events, it is necessary to read more than one account of the history of an event or period if we want to understand it. Indeed, this is the first rule of reading history.
</li><li>History is the story of what led up to now. It is the present that interests us—that and the future. The future will be partly determined by the present. Thus, you can learn something about the future, too, from a historian, even from one who like Thucydides lived more than two thousand years ago.
</li><li>One of the greatest of all biographies is Boswell’s Life of Johnson,
</li><li>You should remember, of course, that if you wish to know the truth about a person’s life, you should read as many biographies of him as you can find, including his own account of his life, if he wrote one. Read biography as history and as the cause of history; take all autobiographies with a grain of salt;
</li><li>Thus the most important thing to know, when reading any report of current happenings, is who is writing the report.
</li><li>Thus we have no hesitation in recommending that you try to read at least some of the great scientific classics of our tradition. In fact, there is really no excuse for not trying to read them. None of them is impossibly difficult, not even a book like Newton’s Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, if you are willing to make the effort.
</li><li>We are also not told, at least not early enough, how beautiful and how intellectually satisfying mathematics can be. It is probably not too late for anyone to see this if he will go to a little trouble. You might start with Euclid, whose Elements of Geometry is one of the most lucid and beautiful works of any kind that has ever been written.
</li><li>Newton’s Optics is another scientific classic that you might want to try to read.
</li><li>such excellent popular books as Whitehead’s Introduction to Mathematics, Lincoln Barnett’s The Universe and Dr. Einstein, and Barry Commoner’s The Closing Circle,
</li><li>We are not required to think as children in order to understand existence. Children certainly do not, and cannot, understand it—if, indeed, anyone can. But we must be able to see as children see, to wonder as they wonder, to ask as they ask. The complexities of adult life get in the way of the truth. The great philosophers have always been able to clear away the complexities and see simple distinctions—simple once they are stated, vastly difficult before. If we are to follow them we too must be childishly simple in our questions—and maturely wise in our replies.
</li><li>When you learn something that you did not know before, you have certainly changed with respect to the knowledge you have acquired, but you are also the same individual that you were before; if that were not the case, you could not be said to have changed through learning.
</li><li>Up to about 1930, or perhaps even a little later, philosophical books were written for the general reader.
</li><li>All Western philosophy, Whitehead once remarked, is but “a footnote to Plato”;
</li><li>Many readers fear that it would be disloyal to their commitment to stand apart and impersonally question what they are reading. Yet this is necessary whenever you read analytically. Such a stance is implied by the rules of reading, at least by the rules of structural outlining and interpretation. If you are going to answer the first two questions that should be asked of anything you read, you must, as it were, check your opinions at the door.
</li><li>In this sense, syntopical reading is the most active reading you can do. Analytical reading is also active, of course. But when you read a book analytically, you put yourself in a relation to it of disciple to master. When you read syntopically, you must be the master of the situation.
</li><li>If you are reading in order to become a better reader, you cannot read just any book or article. You will not improve as a reader if all you read are books that are well within your capacity. You must tackle books that are beyond you, or, as we have said, books that are over your head. Only books of that sort will make you stretch your mind. And unless you stretch, you will not learn.
</li><li>The great majority of the several million books that have been written in the Western tradition alone—more than 99 per cent of them—will not make sufficient demands on you for you to improve your skill in reading.
</li><li>There is an old test—it was quite popular a generation ago—that was designed to tell you which books are the ones that can do this for you. Suppose, the test went, that you know in advance that you will be marooned on a desert island for the rest of your life, or at least for a long period. Suppose, too, that you have time to prepare for the experience. There are certain practical and useful articles that you would be sure to take with you. You will also be allowed ten books. Which ones would you select?
</li><li>But we would recommend starting with a good anthology of poetry rather than with the collected works of a single author. Palgrave’s The Golden Treasury and The Oxford Book of English Verse are excellent places to start. These older anthologies should be supplemented by more modern ones—for example, Selden Rodman’s One Hundred Modern Poems, a collection widely available in paperback that extends the notion of a lyric poem in interesting ways. Since reading lyric poetry requires special skill, we would also recommend any of several available handbooks on the subject—for example, Mark Van Doren’s Introduction to Poetry, an anthology that also contains short discussions of how to read many famous lyrics.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Sunday, March 20, 2022 1:39:22 PM
</h4><ul><li>The practice of Zen mind is beginner’s mind. The innocence of the first inquiry—what am I?—is needed throughout Zen practice. The mind of the beginner is empty, free of the habits of the expert, ready to accept, to doubt, and open to all the possibilities. It is the kind of mind which can see things as they are, which step by step and in a flash can realize the original nature of everything.
</li><li>In the beginner’s mind there is no thought, “I have attained something.” All self-centered thoughts limit our vast mind. When we have no thought of achievement, no thought of self, we are true beginners. Then we can really learn something.
</li><li>Even though waves arise, the essence of your mind is pure; it is just like clear water with a few waves. Actually water always has waves. Waves are the practice of the water. To speak of waves apart from water or water apart from waves is a delusion. Water and waves are one. Big mind and small mind are one.
</li><li>Building character is like making bread—you have to mix it little by little, step by step, and moderate temperature is needed. You know yourself quite well, and you know how much temperature you need. You know exactly what you need. But if you get too excited, you will forget how much temperature is good for you, and you will lose your own way. This is very dangerous.
</li><li>And we should forget, day by day, what we have done; this is true nonattachment. And we should do something new. To do something new, of course we must know our past, and this is all right. But we should not keep holding on to anything we have done; we should only reflect on it. And we must have some idea of what we should do in the future. But the future is the future, the past is the past; now we should work on something new. This is our attitude, and how we should live in this world.
</li><li>When we practice zazen we limit our activity to the smallest extent. Just keeping the right posture and being concentrated on sitting is how we express the universal nature. Then we become Buddha, and we express Buddha nature. So instead of having some object of worship, we just concentrate on the activity which we do in each moment.
</li><li>But once I had left Eiheiji and been away for some time, coming back was different. I heard the various sounds of practice—the bells and the monks reciting the sutra—and I had a deep feeling. There were tears flowing out of my eyes, nose, and mouth! It is the people who are outside of the monastery who feel its atmosphere. Those who are practicing actually do not feel anything. I think this is true for everything. When we hear the sound of the pine trees on a windy day, perhaps the wind is just blowing, and the pine tree is just standing in the wind. That is all that they are doing. But the people who listen to the wind in the tree will write a poem, or will feel something unusual. That is, I think, the way everything is. So
</li><li>Dogen-zenji said, “To study Buddhism is to study ourselves. To study ourselves is to forget ourselves.”
</li><li>Dogen-zenji said, “When you say something to someone, he may not accept it, but do not try to make him understand it intellectually. Do not argue with him; just listen to his objections until he himself finds something wrong with them.”
</li><li>The most important things in our practice are our physical posture and our way of breathing. We are not so concerned about a deep understanding of Buddhism. As a philosophy, Buddhism is a very deep, wide, and firm system of thought, but Zen is not concerned about philosophical understanding. We emphasize practice.
</li><li>We do not slight the idea of attaining enlightenment, but the most important thing is this moment, not some day in the future. We have to make our effort in this moment. This is the most important thing for our practice.
</li><li>You do not have to force yourself to drink water when you are thirsty; you are glad to drink water.
</li><li>As long as we have some definite idea about or some hope in the future, we cannot really be serious with the moment that exists right now. You may say, “I can do it tomorrow, or next year,” believing that something that exists today will exist tomorrow. Even though you are not trying so hard, you expect that some promising thing will come, as long as you follow a certain way. But there is no certain way that exists permanently. There is no way set up for us. Moment after moment we have to find our own way. Some idea of perfection, or some perfect way which is set up by someone else, is not the true way for us.

</li><li>We were father and son with such demented, uneven hair--embodiments of one of Dad's favorite ideas that I only truly understood much later: there's freedom in looking crazy.
</li><li>Maybe he knew it was there I would learn the second part to that story, that I would inevitably discover another, crucial ingredient to my own distinctive identity soup.
</li><li>The futility of the attempt was obvious; when you put in that much effort to forget someone, the effort itself becomes a memory. Then you have to forget the forgetting, and that too is memorable.
</li><li>"Listen, Jasper. Pride is the first thing you need to do away with in life. It's there to make you feel good about yourself. It's like putting a suit on a shriveled carrot and taking it out to the theater and pretending it's someone important. The first step in self-liberation is to be free of self-respect. I understand why it's useful for some. When people have nothing, they can still have their pride. That's why the poor were given the myth of nobility, because the cupboards were bare. Are you listening to me? This is important, Jasper. I don't want you to have anything to do with nobility, pride, or self-respect. They're tools to help you bronze your own head."
</li><li>"People don't understand me, Jasper. And that's OK, but it's sometimes irritating, because they think they do. But all they see is the facade I use in company, and in truth, I have made very few adjustments to the Martin Dean persona over the years. Oh sure, a touch-up here, a touch-up there, you know, to move with the times, but it has essentially remained intact from day one. People are always saying that a person's character is unchangeable, but mostly it's the persona that doesn't change, not the person, and underneath that changeless mask exists a creature who's evolving like crazy, mutating out of control. I tell you, the most consistent person you know is more than likely a complete stranger to you, blossoming and sprouting all sorts of wings and branches and third eyes. You could sit beside that person in an office cubicle for ten years and not see the growth spurts going on right under your nose. Honestly, anyone who says a friend of theirs hasn't changed in years just can't tell a mask from an actual face."
</li><li>I had only a splinter of awareness back then that no matter what anybody says, choosing between the available options is not the same as thinking for yourself. The only true way of thinking for yourself is to create options of your own, options that don't exist.
</li><li>Every day she brought me drinks, but I was too shy to talk to her. When she said "Hello," I said "OK."
</li><li>Tears came to my eyes, but I fought them. Then I started thinking about tears. What was evolution up to when it rendered the human body incapable of concealing sadness? Is it somehow crucial to the survival of the species that we can't hide our melancholy? Why? What's the evolutionary benefit of crying? To elicit sympathy? Does evolution have a Machiavellian streak? After a big cry, you always feel drained and exhausted and sometimes embarrassed, especially if the tears come after watching a television commercial for tea bags. Is it evolution's design to humble us? To humiliate us?
</li><li>You experience life alone, you can be as intimate with another as much as you like, but there has to be always a part of you and your existence that is incommunicable; you die alone, the experience is yours alone, you might have a dozen spectators who love you, but your isolation, from birth to death, is never fully penetrated. What if death is the same aloneness, though, for eternity? An incommunicable, cruel, and infinite loneliness. We don't know what death is. Maybe it's that.
</li><li>I lit a cigarette and stood at the door of the shed and looked up at the sky. It was a dark night with only three stars visible, and not the famous ones. I put a hand in my pocket and felt the scrunched-up wads of cash. After all the lectures I'd given Terry about crime, how could I do this? Wouldn't that make me a hypocrite? And so what if it did? Is being a hypocrite such a terrible thing? Doesn't hypocrisy actually demonstrate flexibility in a person? If you stand by your principles, doesn't that mean you're rigid and close-minded? Yes, I have principles, but so what? Does that mean I have to live my life unbendingly by them? I chose the principles unconsciously to guide my behavior, but can't a person assert his conscious mind to override the unconscious? Who's the boss here, anyway? And am I to trust my young self to dictate the standards of my behavior throughout my whole life? And might I not be wrong about everything? Why should I bind myself to the musings of my own brain?
</li><li>I watched her as she drank & thought her face was one that you have to earn--there was a world-weariness in that face as if it had seen all the acts of creation & all the acts of destruction & had gotten stuck in the bottleneck of history & crawled out naked over miles & miles of broken bodies & machine parts & wound up here in this bar for a quick glass of champagne to rinse the taste of holocaust from her mouth.
</li><li>maybe because she often seems so genuinely pleased simply to be with me--something inside me irritated at the idea that I have the capacity to make someone else happy just by existing when my existence has never done anything for me.
</li><li>And why am I like that? Is it because I have no self-love? I have self-like but is it enough?
</li><li>This morning passed horribly deformed beggar who was for all practical purposes merely a torso rattling a cup--was it really me who gave him 100 francs & said Take the day off? It wasn't me, not exactly. It was one of my selves, one of the multitudes. Some of them laugh at me. Others bite their nails in suspense. One snorts with derision. That's how they are, the multitudes. Some of the selves are children & some are parents. That's why every man is his own father & his own son. With the years if you learn enough you can learn how to shed your selves like dead skin cells. Sometimes they come out of you & walk around. Yes I'm changing. Change is when new selves come into foreground while others recede into forgotten landscapes. Maybe definition of having lived full life is when every citizen in the hall of selves gets to take you for a spin--the commander the lover the coward the misanthrope the fighter the priest the moral guardian the immoral guardian the lover of life the hater of life the fool the judge the jury the executioner--when every last soul is satisfied at moment of death. If only one of the selves has been nothing but a spectator or a tourist then the life is incomplete.
</li><li>"Jasper. Listen. You can never really kill your old selves. They lie there in a mass grave, buried alive, one on top of the other, waiting for the opportunity for resurrection, and then, because they've once been dead, they drive you like a zombie, as they themselves are zombies. Do you see what I'm getting at? All your old failures squirming to life!"
</li><li>Pascal notes that during the French Revolution, all the nuthouses were emptied. The inmates suddenly had meaning in their lives.
</li><li>Humans are unique in this world in that, as opposed to all other animals, they have developed a consciousness so advanced that it has one awful byproduct: they are the only creatures aware of their own mortality. This truth is so terrifying that from a very early age humans bury it deep in their unconscious, and this has turned people into red-blooded machines, fleshy factories that manufacture meaning. The meaning they feel becomes channeled into their immortality projects--such as their children, or their gods, or their artistic works, or their businesses, or their nations--that they believe will outlive them. And here's the problem: people feel they need these beliefs in order to live but are unconsciously suicidal because of their beliefs. That's why when a person sacrifices his life for a religious cause, he has chosen to die not for a god but in the service of an unconscious primal fear. So it is this fear that causes him to die of the very thing he is afraid of. You see? The irony of their immortality projects is that while they have been designed by the unconscious to fool the person into a sense of specialness and into a bid for everlasting life, the manner in which they fret about their immortality projects is the very thing that kills them. This is where you have to be careful. This is my warning to you. My road warning. The denial of death rushes people into an early grave, and if you are not careful, they will take you with them."
</li><li>"OK. Listen to this. With our population of roughly twenty million people, if everyone in Australia mailed just one dollar a week to a certain address and that money was divided by twenty, every single week of the year twenty Australian families would become millionaires."
</li><li>I half managed to convince people that if instead of singing the national anthem we started each day with a little funeral service for ourselves, if we all resigned ourselves to our inevitable decay and stopped seeking a heroic transcendence of our unfortunate fate, we might not go as far as Hitler, who was so perturbed about dying that he tried to avoid thinking about it by killing six million Jews.
</li><li>Never once did I think of Caroline or Jasper. If I have made one unpardonable error in my life, it's to deny, all the time, that there are people who might genuinely love me.
</li><li>Why is it that as soon as we shed fur and learned to stand upright, we gave up evolving, as if smooth skin and a good posture were everything?
</li><li>So then it seemed Anouk was wrong; the real fruit of meditation wasn't inner peace but love. In fact, when you see life in its totality for the first time and you feel genuine love for that totality, inner peace seems like a kind of small, petty goal.
</li><li>"'Nationalism is our form of incest, is our idolatry, is our insanity. "Patriotism"...is its cult...Just as love for one individual which excludes the love for others is not love, love for one's country which is not part of one's love for humanity is not love, but idolatrous worship.'"
</li><li>"You've probably worked out by now that if you think courageous thoughts, you will cross busy streets without looking, and if you think sadistic, venal thoughts, you will find yourself pulling out the chair every time someone is about to sit down. You are what you think. So if you don't want to turn into your father, you don't want to think yourself into a corner like he did--you need to think yourself into the open, and the only way to do that is to enjoy not knowing whether you're right or wrong, play the game of life without trying to work out the rules. Stop judging the living, enjoy futility, don't be disillusioned with murder, remember that fasting men survive while starving men die, laugh as your illusions collapse, and above all, always bless every single minute of this silly season in hell."
</li><li>Dad always maintained that people don't go on journeys at all but spend a lifetime searching for and gathering evidence to rationalize the beliefs they've held in their hearts since day one. They have new revelations, certainly, but these rarely shatter their core belief structure--they just build on it. He believed that if the base remains intact, it doesn't matter what you build on it, it is not a journey at all. It is just layering. He didn't believe that anyone ever started from scratch. "People aren't looking for answers," he often said. "They're looking for facts to prove their case."

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Tuesday, April 12, 2022 1:19:44 AM
</h4><ul><li>In truth, life is really the author of this book. She is the one who manifested the flow of events that were so powerful and fascinating they demanded narration.
</li><li>What manifests in front of us at any given moment is actually something truly extraordinary—it is the end result of all the forces that have been interacting together for billions of years. We are not responsible for even the tiniest fraction of what is manifesting around us.
</li><li>If life brought events in front of me, I would treat them as if they came to take me beyond myself. If my personal self complained, I would use each opportunity to simply let him go and surrender to what life was presenting me. This was the birth of what I came to call “the surrender experiment,” and I was totally prepared to see where it would take me.
</li><li>My formula for success was very simple: Do whatever is put in front of you with all your heart and soul without regard for personal results. Do the work as though it were given to you by the universe itself—because it was.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Thursday, May 12, 2022 4:57:37 PM
</h4><ul><li>We urge you to regard with great skepticism any sentence that begins “Everybody knows…” or “Common sense tells us…” Often, these phrases are signposts for cultural belief systems that may be antisexual, monogamy-centrist, and/or codependent.
</li><li>We recommend that when you are in the company of the unfamiliar, you look for unfamiliar wisdom. You’ll find lots of it, and it will make you richer.
</li><li>Listen to your fears: they have a lot to teach you about yourself. Not knowing what’s what can feel scary—but think of it as a chance to scrap all your preconceptions and start from scratch. It’s only by recognizing all the possibilities out there that you can choose the ones that work for you. Then you can be free to figure out where you want the boundaries in your life, what your personal limits are, and whether you ever want to expand those limits. Accomplishing this amazing task will set you free to explore beyond your wildest dreams.
</li><li>A basic precept of intimate communication is that each person owns their own feelings. No one “makes” you feel jealous or insecure— the person who makes you feel that way is you. No matter what the other person is doing, what you feel in response is determined inside you. Even when somebody deliberately tries to hurt you, you make a choice about how you feel. You might feel angry or hurt or frightened or guilty. The choice, not usually conscious, happens inside you.
</li><li>What you are not responsible for is your lover’s emotions. You can choose to be supportive—we’re great believers in the healing power of listening—but it is not your job to fix anything. Once you understand that your lover’s emotions are not your job or your fault, you can listen and really hear without falling victim to an overwhelming need to figure out whose fault it is or to make the emotion change or go away.
</li><li>Painful feelings, even the most intense of them, have a tendency to run their course if you let them, so an initial strategy is to make yourself as comfortable as possible and wait. Find your jealous feelings—hurt or anger or whatever—and let them flow through you, like a river.
</li><li>A final note about love: One remedy for the fear of not being loved is to remember how good it feels to love someone. If you’re feeling unloved and you want to feel better, go love someone and see what happens.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Monday, May 16, 2022 5:05:45 PM
</h4><ul><li>Harvard itself had conducted experiments in the 1950s on the mind-altering effects of LSD. Later it was revealed that this research was sponsored by the Central Intelligence Agency, as part of its MK-Ultra project.
</li><li>After two or three more days, I was talking about the psilocybin trip in the past tense. My personality patterns kept infiltrating my newly liberated mind, old thought habits sneakily reasserting themselves.
</li><li>Coming down from an acid trip, it was hard to communicate what had happened, because the drug took you to a plane that was so different from normal waking consciousness that words were useless. Sometimes you couldn’t even remember the trip because the memory was specific to that other state. Sometimes your experience went so far beyond the discursive thought process that you saw people around you almost as artificial, mechanical figures caught in a dream world.
</li><li>Tim’s observations also foreshadowed the fundamental realization we’d have a few years later about psychedelics in general: that a trip is just that—a trip—and you have to come back. At the end of the day, for all your new insight, you still have to take out the garbage.
</li><li>What was most striking about acid, though, was that it made mysticism and spirituality practically inescapable. You’d come out of a session reeling with awe, your ego having been dissolved into colors and sensations. You were shaken to your core by the awareness of a divine life energy. Even the criminals at the Concord prison used religious imagery to describe their LSD trips.
</li><li>In that moment, Maharaj-ji breaks me out of my self-contained universe, my egocentric world. Instead of seeing my life as a personal history or career, I see myself as a pilgrim on a spiritual journey. I am no longer an isolated ego narrating my own story line; I am a soul, evolving toward oneness. I am a pinprick of awareness in the star field of the cosmos. I am part of it all.
</li><li>My mother always fed everybody who came to our house. Maharaj-ji did the same at his temples. When we asked Maharaj-ji how to raise kundalini, the spiritual energy, he said simply, “Feed everyone and love everyone. Remember God.”
</li><li>The less attached you are to your own desires, the more you can hear what other human beings need, and the less you project your own needs. Your response is more compassionate and appropriate to the need at hand. That doesn’t mean you don’t have desires.
</li><li>One woman reported on her interaction with a neighborhood homeless man. “I realized,” she said, “that though I gave him money, I had never really acknowledged his existence as a fellow human being. I was afraid. I was afraid that if I opened up to him, he’d end up living in my apartment.” Her words captured exactly what I had been feeling. I’d been afraid to open my heart to the suffering of others because I feared I would be consumed, unable to set limits.

</h4><ul><li>Compassion is seeing others as ourselves, expanding our identity to include the other person. When I sit with an AIDS patient, I know it could be me. When I sit with a dying person, I know that I too will die. Sitting with the women in Guatemala, their suffering was also mine. Behind our suffering, we share love.
</li><li>I like to think of my body as a coach, with horses and a coachman. My soul rides inside the coach. The horses are desires, the coachman the ego—the “I” that controls the desires and watches where he’s going … and makes sure the foot doesn’t go in the wrong place. Now and then my coach needs a grease job or a new bearing or a hip joint replaced. But my soul, inside the coach, rides along, merrily, merrily, merrily. I am still here. Just hipper than ever.
</li><li>Gandhi said, “When you surrender completely to God as the only Truth worth having, you find yourself in the service of all that exists. It becomes your joy and recreation. You never tire of serving others.”
</li><li>Meher Baba said, “Love is like a disease. Those who don’t have it catch it from those who do.”
</li><li>Since I am a bhakta, a devotee on the path of love, from the soul perception I see the world around me as love, as the Beloved. The trees moving in the wind are love. The universe is love. I am a loving point of awareness in the vastness. This consciousness is part of the One. The One is another word for God. God uses your consciousness or my consciousness to talk to himSelf or herSelf, to ourSelf. We are writing this book and reading it to ourSelf.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Friday, May 20, 2022 4:13:48 PM
</h4><ul><li>With so many siblings between us, growing up, it was easy to feel as though the two of us existed in the same solar system but never visited each other’s planets.
</li><li>Maybe you know exactly what you dream of being. Or maybe you’re paralyzed because you have no idea what your passion is. The truth is, it doesn’t matter. You don’t have to know. You just have to keep moving forward. You just have to keep doing something, seizing the next opportunity, staying open to trying something new. It doesn’t have to fit your vision of the perfect job or the perfect life. Perfect is boring, and dreams are not real. Just . . . DO.
</li><li>Find a cause you love. It’s okay to just pick one. You are going to need to spend a lot of time out in the real world trying to figure out how to stop being a lost loser so one cause is good. But find one. And devote some time every week to it.
</li><li>Losing yourself does not happen all at once. Losing yourself happens one no at a time. No to going out tonight. No to catching up with that old college roommate. No to attending that party. No to going on a vacation. No to making a new friend. Losing yourself happens one pound at a time.
</li><li>The Year of Yes, I realize, has become a snowball rolling down a hill. Each yes rolls into the next into the next and the snowball is growing and growing and growing. Every yes changes something in me. Every yes is a bit more transformative. Every yes sparks some new phase of evolution.
</li><li>No one is obligated to compliment you. They do it out of kindness. They do it because they want to. They do it because they believe the compliment they are offering. So when you negate someone’s compliment, you are telling them they are wrong. You’re telling them they wasted their time. You are questioning their taste and judgment. You are insulting them.
</li><li>The years and years of saying no were, for me, a quiet way to let go. A silent means of giving up. An easy withdrawal from the world, from light, from life. Saying no was a way to disappear. Saying no was my own slow form of suicide.
</li><li>I realized a very simple truth: that success, fame, having all my dreams come true would not fix or improve me, it wasn’t an instant potion for personal growth. Having all my dreams come true only seemed to magnify whatever qualities I already possessed.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Monday, May 23, 2022 3:25:30 AM
</h4><ul><li>"Our main business is not to see what lies dimly at a distance, but to do what lies clearly at hand."
</li><li>"I have practiced that philosophy ever since that memorable day that an Army doctor gave it to me.’One grain of sand at a time. One task at a time.'
</li><li>"Anyone can carry his burden, however hard, until nightfall," wrote Robert Louis Stevenson. "Anyone can do his work, however hard, for one day. Anyone can live sweetly, patiently, lovingly, purely, till the sun goes down. And this is all that life really means."
</li><li>Why mar the beauty of living today by trying to solve the problems of a future that is shrouded in ceaseless change and uncertainty a future that no one can possibly foretell?
</li><li>When we worry, our minds jump here and there and everywhere, and we lose all power of decision. However, when we force ourselves to face the worst and accept it mentally, we then eliminate all those vague imaginings and put ourselves in a position in which we are able to concentrate on our problem.
</li><li>Lin Yutang in his widely read book, The Importance of Living.
</li><li>For years, whenever I was worried I had always gone to my typewriter and written down two questions and the answers to these questions:     1. What am I worrying about?     2. What can I do about it? "I used to try to answer those questions without writing them down. But I stopped that years ago. I found that writing down both the questions and the answers clarifies my thinking.
</li><li>"I must lose myself in action, lest I wither in despair."
</li><li>In his book Alone, Admiral Byrd tells all about those five months he spent in bewildering and soul-shattering darkness. The days were as black as the nights.
</li><li>Disraeli said: "Life is too short to be little." "Those words," said Andre Maurois in This Week magazine, "have helped me through many a painful experience: often we allow ourselves to be upset by small things we should despise and forget. Here we are on this earth, with only a few more decades to live, and we lose many irreplaceable hours brooding over grievances that, in a year's time, will be forgotten by us and by everybody. No, let us devote our life to worth-while actions and feelings, to great thoughts, real affections and enduring undertakings. For life is too short to be little."
</li><li>“‘By the law of averages, it won't happen.' That phrase has destroyed ninety percent of my worries; and it has made the past twenty years of my life beautiful and peaceful beyond my highest expectations."
</li><li>Dr. G. Canby Robinson declared that four out of five patients admitted to Johns Hopkins Hospital were suffering from conditions brought on in part by emotional strains and stresses.
</li><li>When we hate our enemies, we are giving them power over us: power over our sleep, our appetites, our blood pressure, our health, and our happiness. Our enemies would dance with joy if only they knew how they were worrying us, lacerating us and getting even with us! Our hate is not hurting them, but our hate is turning our own days and nights into a hellish turmoil.
</li><li>If you saved a man's life, would you expect him to be grateful? You might, but Samuel Leibowitz, who was a famous criminal lawyer before he became a judge, saved seventy-eight men from going to the electric chair! How many of these men, do you suppose, stopped to thank Samuel Leibowitz, or ever took the trouble to send him a Christmas card? How many? Guess. That's right, none.
</li><li>Here is the first point I am trying to make in this chapter: It is natural for people to forget to be grateful; so, if we go around expecting gratitude, we are headed straight for a lot of heartaches.
</li><li>All the days of our years we have been living in a fairyland of beauty, but we have been too blind to see, too satiated to enjoy.
</li><li>"The biggest mistake people make in applying for jobs is in not being themselves. Instead of taking their hair down and being completely frank, they often try to give you the answers they think you want."
</li><li>"Compared to what we ought to be," he wrote, "we are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and mental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use."
</li><li>"The most important thing in life is not to capitalize on your gains. Any fool can do that. The really important thing is to profit from your losses. That requires intelligence; and it makes the difference between a man of sense and a fool."
</li><li>Suppose we are so discouraged that we feel there is no hope of our ever being able to turn our lemons into lemonade, then here are two reasons why we ought to try, anyway, two reasons why we have everything to gain and nothing to lose. Reason one: We may succeed. Reason two: Even if we don't succeed, the mere attempt to turn our minus into a plus will cause us to look forward instead of backward; it will replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts; it will release creative energy and spur us to get so busy that we won't have either the time or the inclination to mourn over what is past and forever gone.
</li><li>This statement was made by Alfred Adler. He used to say to his melancholia patients: "You can be cured in fourteen days if you follow this prescription. Try to think every day how you can please someone."
</li><li>Dr. Adler's splendid book, What Life Should Mean to You.
</li><li>If we are going "to make things better for others", as Dreiser advocated, let's be quick about it. Time is a wastin'. "I shall pass this way but once. Therefore any good that I can do or any kindness that I can show, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again."
</li><li>Francis Bacon was right when he said, three hundred and fifty years ago: "A little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism; but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion."
</li><li>One of the most distinguished psychiatrists living, Dr. Carl Jung, says in his book Modern Man in Search of a Soul: "During the past thirty years, people from all the civilized countries of the earth have consulted me. I have treated many hundreds of patients. Among all my patients in the second half of life, that is to say, over thirty-five, there has not been one whose problem in the last resort was not that of finding a religious outlook on life. It is safe to say that every one of them fell ill because he had lost that which the living religions of every age have given to their followers, and none of them has been really healed who did not regain his religious outlook."
</li><li>So when you are kicked and criticized, remember that it is often done because it gives the kicker a feeling of importance. It often means that you are accomplishing something and are worthy of attention.
</li><li>I realize now that people are not thinking about you and me or caring what is said about us. They are thinking about themselves, before breakfast, after breakfast, and right on until ten minutes past midnight. They would be a thousand times more concerned about a slight headache of their own than they would about the news of your death or mine.
</li><li>Dr. Jacobson has written two books on relaxation: Progressive Relaxation and You Must Relax,
</li><li>"Most people have the idea that the heart is working all the time. As a matter of fact, there is a definite rest period after each contraction. When beating at a moderate rate of seventy pulses per minute, the heart is actually working only nine hours out of the twenty-four. In the aggregate its rest periods total a full fifteen hours per day."
</li><li>During World War II, Winston Churchill, in his late sixties and early seventies, was able to work sixteen hours a day, year after year, directing the war efforts of the British Empire. A phenomenal record. His secret? He worked in bed each morning until eleven o'clock, reading papers, dictating orders, making telephone calls, and holding important conferences. After lunch he went to bed once more and slept for an hour. In the evening he went to bed once more and slept for two hours before having dinner at eight. He didn't cure fatigue. He didn't have to cure it. He prevented it. Because he rested frequently, he was able to work on, fresh and fit, until long past midnight.
</li><li>In his excellent book. Why Be Tired, Daniel W. Josselyn observes: "Rest is not a matter of doing absolutely nothing. Rest is repair." There is so much repair power in a short period of rest that even a five-minute nap will help to forestall fatigue!
</li><li>"I measure my accomplishments," says Daniel W. Josselyn, "not by how tired I am at the end of the day, but how tired I am not." He says: "When I feel particularly tired at the end of the day, or when irritability proves that my nerves are tired, I know beyond question that it has been an inefficient day both as to quantity and quality."
</li><li>Stay out of activities where the chances are only one out of ten of your being able to make a living.
</li><li>Experts on budgets recommend that we keep an accurate account of every nickel we spend for at least the first month and, if possible, for three months. This is to give us an accurate record of where our money goes, so we can draw up a budget.
</li><li>"If you have what seems to you insufficient," said one of Rome's greatest philosophers, Seneca, "then you will be miserable even if you possess the world."
</li><li>"Sometimes when I have too many things to do all at once, I sit down and relax and smoke my pipe for an hour and do nothing."
</li><li>When I am worried about something, I try to see my troubles in their proper perspective. I say to myself: "Two months from now I shall not be worrying about this bad break, so why worry about it now? Why not assume now the same attitude that I will have two months from now?"
</li><li>For I have lived. They only existed. I have drank the cup of life down to its very dregs. They have only sipped the bubbles on top of it. I know things they will never know. I see things to which they are blind. It is only the women whose eyes have been washed clear with tears who get the broad vision that makes them little sisters to all the world.
</li><li>As the years have gone by, I have found that time automatically takes care of most of my worries. In fact, I frequently find it difficult to remember what I was worrying about a week ago. So I have a rule: never to fret over a problem until it is at least a week old.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Wednesday, May 25, 2022 12:57:03 AM
</h4><ul><li>It was Ram Dass who spoke with wisdom. He said that we all are born in each moment and we all die in each moment. With each in breath, we take in life, and with each out breath, we give it up again.
</li><li>“In the Mahabharata, the sage Yudhisthira is asked, ‘Of all things in life, what is the most amazing?’ He answers that a man, seeing others die all around him, never thinks that he will die. But everyone dies. Each of us will die. We just don’t know when.”
</li><li>“When I am afraid of something, I come up as close to it as possible, and I notice my resistance. I allow myself to just notice the resistance, because the resistance intensifies the fear—there’s no doubt about it. Get as close to the fear as you can, noticing the boundaries of it, just being with it, seeing it as it is. Don’t grab, don’t push it away, just notice.”
</li><li>The soul teaches us that the root of fear is separateness. If we want to be free, we have to overcome separateness. But usually it feels like you are yelling out of your room, and I am yelling out of mine. Even trying to get out of the room invests the room with reality. Who am I? The room that the mind built. Yet we’ve all had times when there was no room, no fear. The moment of crisis, when we forget ourselves and do just what is needed. For surfers, it is the moment when they come into equilibrium with the incredible force of the water. For skiers, it is when the balance is perfect. But we explain it away, ignore it, or let it pass. We each come out of that room in our own ways, again and again. We turn and look and realize we’re out—and we panic. We run back in the room, close the door, panting heavily. Now I know where I am, we think. I’m back home. Alone. Safe. No matter how squalid the room.
</li><li>Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, the psychiatrist who did pioneering work on death and grief, said to him later, “Ram Dass, we are all on death row.” We just need to remember that. Their advantage is that they couldn’t pretend they were not going to die, the way we do much of the time.
</li><li>But as the Russian philosopher G. I. Gurdjieff said, “If you wish to escape from prison, the first thing you must realize is that you are in prison. If you think you’re free, no escape is possible.”
</li><li>The ego is not built on love. It’s built on the fear of not surviving, and if that’s who you think you are, then you’re fearful all the time. And because you’re fearful, you overcompensate and make decisions that further separate you from others and yourself.
</li><li>Gopi told us to think of ourselves as an ice cube, with our own cubic shape, white-blue color, cold temperature, and slippery texture—our iciness. We are pretty identified with being an ice cube, always at zero degrees centigrade. But if we’re dropped into the ocean, our limited identity disappears as we merge into the vastness, becoming one with the sea, our iciness gone but our essence still there. We become part of the One.
</li><li>“We are all one. We are all talking to ourselves when we talk to one another. There is the plane of the ego, the plane of the soul, and the plane of the One. As you go on, you gravitate toward the One. Compassion comes from that realization of our oneness. When another person is suffering, you are suffering. When you help that person, you are helping yourself. When you love that person, you are also loving yourself.”
</li><li>“Love is empowering. People want to be with you, Ram Dass, because you love them. And then they feel like they have new strength to go on with what they know they should be doing. I’ve heard so many people say that. It’s empowering to be loved. I mean, look at what happened to you with Maharaj-ji.”
</li><li>I’m going to start telling people more often what it is I love about them so they can hear it while they are living. I’m changing my to-do list from the tasks I faithfully work through every week to “tell friends what I love about them; die without regrets.”
</li><li>On Death and Dying
</li><li>I say, “I think that going through suffering makes us more real, more human. I realized at one point that I am drawn to people who have suffered because they are wiser, more present. We don’t wish suffering on ourselves or anyone, but it is the way we grow.”
</li><li>And what is this soul? It is a unique entity, which clothes itself in a personality and body when the time is right to take birth on the physical human plane. This personality and body are much like spacesuits for dwelling on earth. Inevitably, in all but the rarest cases, within a few years, the infant becomes so strongly identified with its spacesuit that it loses its memory of its original identity as a soul. Then we live out life engaged in our human vocations until our death, when we leave behind the spacesuit and once again remember our true selves as souls.
</li><li>Now the soul itself has an agenda in taking birth as a human being. It has certain work to do and complete while on the earth plane. It uses the body and personality to carry out this work, and when this work is finished, it leaves this plane. The wisest beings with whom I have made contact in this lifetime all assure me that a soul leaves the physical plane neither a moment too early nor a moment too late.
</li><li>We get so attached to our senses and thoughts about a person as object that we feel desperate when we lose them; we feel we’ve lost something. Then we quiet down, and we realize that we’ve moved to a new level of richness of being together.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Sunday, May 29, 2022 4:12:34 PM
</h4><ul><li>By the end of the decade, Rajneesh’s organization would claim more than five hundred meditation centers around the world.
</li><li>Bhagwan made clear in his discourses that anybody who questioned or criticized him or any aspect of the community should leave. “Your votes will never be taken,” he told disciples in 1978. “Whatsoever I decide is absolute. If you don’t chose [sic] that way, you are perfectly happy to leave.”
</li><li>Over the course of multiple discourses, Bhagwan expounded on his grand utopian vision for the “New Commune,” where he would create a novel species he called the “New Man”: a multifaceted being with all the objectiveness of a scientist, the sensitivity of a poet, and the deep spirituality of a mystic. He described this ideal person as a “Zorba the Buddha,” blending the decadent joyfulness of Zorba the Greek with Buddha’s spirituality.
</li><li>Life at the New Commune would be free of all the traditional institutions and obligations that repressed an individual’s growth. No more nuclear families or marriages, those ancient relics that only encouraged people to control each other. Couples would make no commitment except to love each other in the moment. Although Bhagwan discouraged his sannyasins from having kids—and in fact urged them to get sterilized and have abortions—any children at the New Commune would be raised by the entire community, allowing them to learn from many different role models. No more rat-race careers, no more working for a paycheck, and no more religions. Bhagwan’s sannyasins would practice a form of spirituality that transcended labels, without any dogma or strictures. Everybody would live richly, working side by side with playfulness, love, and laughter, with no ulterior motive other than to support the community and each other. The New Commune would become Bhagwan’s “Buddhafield,” where he could share his enlightened energy with all of his disciples and, eventually, the entire world.
</li><li>The property was about 125 square miles, larger than the cities of Baltimore, Orlando, and Milwaukee, vast enough to encompass six Manhattans.
</li><li>Sheela had just closed on eighty thousand acres in Oregon for $5.75 million, with a cash down payment of $1.5 million.
</li><li>Oregon had some of the strictest zoning controls in the country. There was no way the state would allow them to build a mixed-use residential/commercial/industrial/agricultural commune for thousands of people on a piece of land designated only for farm use.
</li><li>He uttered a phrase that became inscribed in Deeksha’s memory because it so sickened her: I will succeed where Hitler failed.
</li><li>Bhagwan told Deeksha that for just $5,000 Sheela’s brother could arrange to have a person killed in a way that made it look like an accident.
</li><li>Krishna Deva would later estimate that he knew of at least three hundred to four hundred sham marriages at Rajneeshpuram, and the INS would claim there were as many as five hundred.
</li><li>Just as public health officials in Wasco County realized they were in the midst of a food-borne salmonella outbreak, a second, much larger wave of infections commenced on September 19 and continued through October 10, affecting at least 586 people.
</li><li>All told, 751 people who ate or worked at restaurants in The Dalles in September 1984 were either diagnosed with salmonella gastroenteritis or experienced consistent symptoms. They ranged in age from in utero to eighty-seven years old. At least forty-five of those affected were hospitalized for their symptoms, but no known fatalities were reported from the outbreak.
</li><li>In the final throes of hypothermia, disoriented victims may experience a hot flash that compels them to remove their clothing. They next may engage in an autonomous, primitive urge to dig into the earth for warmth, which causes injuries to the knees, elbows, hands, and feet. It’s considered a hypothermia victim’s last effort to survive, since the burrowing is followed almost immediately by unconsciousness and then death.
</li><li>Bhagwan had a more pointed response. “It is proof enough if you are alive after six months that we have not given poison to you,” he said during a Lao Tzu discourse. “Otherwise, you would not be alive. We never do anything halfheartedly.”
</li><li>Bhagwan returned to Portland to seal his fate in America. His attorneys had struck a deal with federal prosecutors by which he would plead guilty to two counts of immigration fraud (making false statements to a government official and conspiracy to defraud the government), pay $400,000 in fines and costs, and leave the country within five days.
</li><li>On February 6, 1986, after a complex international legal process played out, Sheela, Puja, and Shanti B were extradited from West Germany and returned to Portland. They each faced a unique combination of charges stemming from the attempted murder and poisoning of Devaraj, poisoning Wasco County judges Bill Hulse and Ray Matthew, setting fire to Dan Durow’s office, wiretapping, the salmonella poisoning in The Dalles, and federal immigration charges in the same indictment that had brought down Bhagwan.
</li><li>Sheela was sentenced to twenty years in federal prison, although her attorney predicted—correctly—that she would be out within three to four years under the parole guidelines. She was also required to pay $469,000 in penalties and restitution and give up her permanent resident status. Upon completing her sentence, she would have to leave the United States immediately and would probably never be allowed to return.
</li><li>In recent years, Deeksha has become an outspoken critic of Bhagwan among sannyasin circles online. But she also believes that Sheela manipulated Bhagwan just as much as he manipulated her. “I saw them in a room once doing a dance. Sheela had Bhagwan by the balls, and he had her by the throat. They were both using each other.”
</li></ul></div><div class="book"><h2>The Courage to Be Disliked (Ichiro Kishimi;Fumitake Koga)
</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Sunday, June 5, 2022 2:44:19 AM
</h4><ul><li>Think about it this way. Your friend had the goal of not going out beforehand, and he’s been manufacturing a state of anxiety and fear as a means to achieve that goal. In Adlerian psychology, this is called “teleology.”
</li><li>Adler, in denial of the trauma argument, states the following: “No experience is in itself a cause of our success or failure. We do not suffer from the shock of our experiences—the so-called trauma—but instead we make out of them whatever suits our purposes. We are not determined by our experiences, but the meaning we give them is self-determining.”
</li><li>You did not fly into a rage and then start shouting. It is solely that you got angry so that you could shout. In other words, in order to fulfill the goal of shouting, you created the emotion of anger.
</li><li>Why are you rushing for answers? You should arrive at answers on your own, not rely upon what you get from someone else. Answers from others are nothing more than stopgap measures; they’re of no value.
</li><li>Oh, but being alone isn’t what makes you feel lonely. Loneliness is having other people and society and community around you, and having a deep sense of being excluded from them. To feel lonely, we need other people. That is to say, it is only in social contexts that a person becomes an “individual.”
</li><li>There is nothing particularly wrong with the feeling of inferiority itself. You understand this point now, right? As Adler says, the feeling of inferiority can be a trigger for striving and growth. For instance, if one had a feeling of inferiority with regard to one’s education, and resolved to oneself, I’m not well educated, so I’ll just have to try harder than anyone else, that would be a desirable direction. The inferiority complex, on the other hand, refers to a condition of having begun to use one’s feeling of inferiority as a kind of excuse. So one thinks to oneself, I’m not well educated, so I can’t succeed, or I’m not good-looking, so I can’t get married. When someone is insisting on the logic of “A is the situation, so B cannot be done” in such a way in everyday life, that is not something that fits in the feeling of inferiority category. It is an inferiority complex.
</li><li>Those who go so far as to boast about things out loud actually have no confidence in themselves. As Adler clearly indicates, “The one who boasts does so only out of a feeling of inferiority.”
</li><li>Adler says, “In fact, if we were to ask ourselves who is the strongest person in our culture, the logical answer would be, the baby. The baby rules and cannot be dominated.” The baby rules over the adults with his weakness. And it is because of this weakness that no one can control him.
</li><li>However, once one is released from the schema of competition, the need to triumph over someone disappears. One is also released from the fear that says, Maybe I will lose. And one becomes able to celebrate other people’s happiness with all one’s heart. One may become able to contribute actively to other people’s happiness.
</li><li>Wishing so hard to be recognized will lead to a life of following expectations held by other people who want you to be “this kind of person.” In other words, you throw away who you really are and live other people’s lives.
</li><li>Studying is the child’s task. A parent’s handling of that by commanding the child to study is, in effect, an act of intruding on another person’s task. One is unlikely to avert a collision in this way. We need to think with the perspective of “Whose task is this?” and continually separate one’s own tasks from other people’s tasks.
</li><li>There is a simple way to tell whose task it is. Think, Who ultimately is going to receive the result brought about by the choice that is made?
</li><li>It’s true that one often hears parents today using the phrase “It’s for your own good.” But they are clearly doing so in order to fulfill their own goals, which could be their appearance in the eyes of society, their need to put on airs, or their desire for control, for example. In other words, it is not “for your own good” but for the parents’. And it is because the child senses this deception that he rebels.
</li><li>If you are leading a life of worry and suffering—which stems from interpersonal relationships—learn the boundary of “From here on, that is not my task.” And discard other people’s tasks. That is the first step toward lightening the load and making life simpler.
</li><li>All you can do with regard to your own life is choose the best path that you believe in. On the other hand, what kind of judgment do other people pass on that choice? That is the task of other people, and is not a matter you can do anything about.
</li><li>Adler says, “Children who have not been taught to confront challenges will try to avoid all challenges.”
</li><li>Please grasp this point. If one is living in a such a way as to satisfy other people’s expectations, and one is entrusting one’s own life to others, that is a way of living in which one is lying to oneself and continuing that lying to include the people around one.
</li><li>An adult, who has chosen an unfree way to live, on seeing a young person living freely here and now in this moment, criticizes the youth as being hedonistic. Of course, this is a life-lie that comes out so that the adult can accept his own unfree life. An adult who has chosen real freedom himself will not make such comments and will instead cheer on the will to be free.
</li><li>There is a cost incurred when one wants to exercise one’s freedom. And the cost of freedom in interpersonal relationships is that one is disliked by other people.
</li><li>When Adler refers to community, he goes beyond the household, school, workplace, and local society, and treats it as all-inclusive, covering not only nations and all of humanity but also the entire axis of time from the past to the future—and he includes plants and animals and even inanimate objects.
</li><li>People who are incapable of carrying out the separation of tasks and who are obsessed with the desire for recognition are also extremely self-centered.
</li><li>Say he goes out to buy a loaf of bread. He pays for it with a coin. That coin does not simply go back to the bakers of the bread. It goes to the producers of flour and butter, to the people who deliver those ingredients, to the purveyors of the gasoline used by the delivery vehicles, to people in the oil-producing countries where that fuel comes from, and so on. So it’s all connected. People are never truly alone or separate from community, and cannot be.
</li><li>Therefore, there is a principle of action that I would like you to commit to memory. When we run into difficulties in our interpersonal relations, or when we can no longer see a way out, what we should consider first and foremost is the principle that says, “Listen to the voice of the larger community.”
</li><li>It is when one is able to feel “I am beneficial to the community” that one can have a true sense of one’s worth. This is the answer that would be offered in Adlerian psychology.
</li><li>If you consider things at the level of being, we are of use to others and have worth just by being here. This is an indisputable fact.
</li><li>With regard to this issue of community feeling, there was a person who asked Adler a similar question. Adler’s reply was the following: “Someone has to start. Other people might not be cooperative, but that is not connected to you. My advice is this: you should start. With no regard to whether others are cooperative or not.”
</li><li>Right now, you are thinking, If I were to have confidence in someone unconditionally, I would just get taken advantage of. However, you are not the one who decides whether or not to take advantage. That is the other person’s task. All you need to do is think, What should I do?
</li><li>Why is it necessary to be special? Probably because one cannot accept one’s normal self. And it is precisely for this reason that when being especially good becomes a lost cause, one makes the huge leap to being especially bad—the opposite extreme. But is being normal, being ordinary, really such a bad thing? Is it something inferior? Or, in truth, isn’t everybody normal?
</li><li>Think of it this way: Life is a series of moments, which one lives as if one were dancing, right now, around and around each passing instant. And when one happens to survey one’s surroundings, one realizes, I guess I’ve made it this far. Among those who have danced the dance of the violin, there are people who stay the course and become professional musicians. Among those who have danced the dance of the bar examination, there are people who become lawyers. There are people who have danced the dance of writing and become authors. Of course, it also happens that people end up in entirely different places. But none of these lives came to an end “en route.” It is enough if one finds fulfillment in the here and now one is dancing.
</li><li>We should live more earnestly only here and now. The fact that you think you can see the past, or predict the future, is proof that rather than living earnestly here and now, you are living in a dim twilight. Life is a series of moments, and neither the past nor the future exists. You are trying to give yourself a way out by focusing on the past and the future. What happened in the past has nothing whatsoever to do with your here and now, and what the future may hold is not a matter to think about here and now. If you are living earnestly here and now, you will not be concerned with such things.
</li><li>No matter what moments you are living, or if there are people who dislike you, as long as you do not lose sight of the guiding star of “I contribute to others,” you will not lose your way, and you can do whatever you like.

Many things we think are true are really just our local culture. We can’t see it until we get outside of it.

</h4><ul><li>Yes, Zoey liked her job, and she was good at it; but she had to admit, she was barely making ends meet. In fact, the ends weren’t really meeting at all—more like catching glimpses of each other from across the room every now and then.
</li><li>If you can afford that latte, you can afford this photograph.
</li><li>“Well, you’re not alone. I read a fascinating survey the other day. It said half the people in this country could not put their hands on an extra $400 even in the event of an emergency. Seven out of ten describe themselves as ‘living paycheck to paycheck,’ and many even put their everyday living expenses on credit cards.”
</li><li>“The strange truth, Zoey, is that earning more money—even outrageous amounts of money—does not necessarily lead to wealth. Why not? Because most people, when they earn more, simply spend more.
</li><li>“Here’s what I believe, Zoey. I believe that each one of us was put here on this earth, in this life, to do something, something special. Something no one else can do. And most of us aren’t doing it—because we’re too busy paying everyone else first.”
</li><li>“I understand. A lot of people are skeptical about that. But the reality of it is, since 1926, the first year they started collecting reliable data, the stock market has shown an average annual gain of over 10 percent. Sure, the economy booms and busts, we have bull markets and bear markets. How much you actually earn in any given year depends on the year and what you invest in. But when you get past all the drama and look at the big picture, it all averages out. Markets go up, then down, and then up again—always. There’s never been a market that went down but didn’t ultimately go up again.
</li><li>But the exact number isn’t the point, Zoey. The point is to save and let that number compound for you.”
</li><li>“You married, darlin’?” Georgia asked. Zoey shook her head. “Well, remember this for the future: money is the biggest reason marriages fail—but it’s not money itself, and not even the lack of money. It’s the lack of talking about it and working it out together.
</li><li>“When you grow your income bigger,” Barbara continued, “you just take whatever money problems you have and make those bigger, too. Because your money problems come from your money habits, and those don’t change just because your income goes up. The solution to your money problems isn’t more money; it’s new habits.
</li><li>“The latte factor isn’t about being a penny-pincher or denying yourself. It’s about getting clear on what matters. It’s about the little daily extravagances and frivolities, whatever they may be—the five, ten, twenty dollars a day that you could just as easily redirect toward your own future. From spending on yourself to paying yourself first. It’s about giving up something small to get up to something big.
</li><li>“You know why most people don’t save, Zoey? Or if they do, they save only a pittance, and nothing really significant? Because they just don’t see the point.
</li><li>You know how to make your dreams come true? You buy them . . . a dollar at a time.
</li><li>“At each of those specific moments I just shared, those moments I now regret, I took the safe road. And now I lie here dying, and I will never know what could have happened.”
</li><li>“And remember this,” she added. “When you get to your fork in the road, you will hear two voices: the big-boy voice that says, ‘Be safe, go the safe road!’ And the little-boy voice that says, ‘David, go this way! It’ll be fun! Let’s try!’ That voice, the little-boy voice, the one that’s excited and wants to play—let that little boy come out and play. And tell your friends to do the same.”

</li><li>When I finally went to Europe, at age 30, it was too late: I was already a tad too old and too bougie to stay in youth hostels and hang out with a bunch of 24-year-olds. Plus, by the time I was 30, I had many more responsibilities than I’d had in my early twenties, which made it that much harder to take months off for travel. I finally, unfortunately, had to conclude that I should have just gone earlier.
</li><li>Think about how you can actively enhance your memory dividends. Would it help you to take more photos of your experiences? To plan reunions with people you’ve shared good times with in the past? Compile a video or a photo album?

</li><li>If you spend hours and hours of your life acquiring money and then die without spending all of that money, then you’ve needlessly wasted too many precious hours of your life. There is just no way to get those hours back.
</li><li>Economists generally think that annuities are such a rational way to deal with longevity risk that many experts have long wondered why more people don’t buy annuities—a question economists call “the annuity puzzle.”

Think about it: That’s money that they spent years or decades working hard for. They gave up years of their life while healthy and vibrant to buy a few extra weeks of life when they are sick and immobile. If that’s not irrational, I don’t know what is!
</li><li>For any income group you look at, the age of “inheritance receipt” peaks at around 60. In other words, if you were betting on how old someone will be when they inherit money—assuming you know nothing else except that they stand to inherit—60 is your best bet.
</li><li>“Your salary will only go up, your earning power will only go up,” Levitt recalls his older colleague telling him, in almost a perfect echo of what Joe Farrell told me. “And so you shouldn’t be saving now, you should be borrowing. You should be living today in much the way that you’ll be living in 10 or 15 years, and it’s crazy to actually be scrimping and saving, which is what at least someone like me who was brought up in a middle-class family was taught to do.” Levitt says this was one of the best pieces of financial advice he ever got.
</li><li>She suggested the 50-30-20 rule, which she called the Balanced Money Formula, as a way to help people maintain financial stability. According to this rule, you should budget 50 percent of your income for must-haves (like rent, groceries, and utilities), 30 percent for your personal wants (like travel, entertainment, and dining out), and the remaining 20 percent on building your savings and paying down your debt.
</li><li>If your capacity to enjoy life experiences is higher at some ages than others, then it makes sense to spend more of your money at certain ages than others! For example, because $100,000 has more value in your fifties than it does in your eighties, and your goal is to maximize your enjoyment of your money and your life, it’s in your best interest to shift at least some of that money from your eighties into your fifties.
</li><li>Nothing has a greater effect on your ability to enjoy experiences—at any age—than your health. In fact, health is actually a lot more valuable than money, because no amount of money can ever make up for very poor health—whereas people in good health but with little money can still have many wonderful experiences.
</li><li>Research in psychology backs me up: People who spend money on time-saving purchases experience greater life satisfaction, regardless of their income.
</li><li>When you face a choice, such as whether to go on a trip on your next vacation or to save your money for later, ask yourself, Would I rather have one trip now, or two such trips x years from now?
</li><li>That is what I mean when I say that we die many deaths in the course of our lives: The teenager in you dies, the college student in you dies, the single unattached you dies, the version of you that’s a parent of an infant dies, and so on. Once each of these mini-deaths occurs, there’s no going back.
</li><li>Whether you are spending optimally or spending the way most people spend, your spending in old age is lower than in the middle years, because older people usually don't have the health needed to spend as much on experiences. As a result, unless you spend significantly more in your middle years than most people do, you will fail to die with zero.
</li><li>People are more afraid of running out of money than wasting their life, and that’s got to switch. Your biggest fear ought to be wasting your life and time, not Am I going to have x number of dollars when I’m 80?

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Friday, June 10, 2022 5:13:42 PM
</h4><ul><li>They were, however, prepared to take their chances with whatever opportunities arose. Though operating in an opportunistic manner, without a written plan or strategy, they were getting bigger and bigger all the time. “It was like riding a tiger,” said Miller. “It took you wherever it was going.”
</li><li>When the tourist went back to the U.S. he would declare that while abroad he purchased, say, a Pringle cashmere sweater, which would come as unaccompanied baggage. The order would go to Geneva and would be shipped from a warehouse in Amsterdam. The postman would come to the customer’s door with the package. He would say, ‘You have got to pay duty.’ The customer would say he declared it as unaccompanied baggage when returning from Mexico and give him the receipt. The mailman would send off the receipt. It worked fairly well.”
</li><li>It was a complicated procedure with a six-week wait for delivery, but the savings for the customer could be as high as 50 percent. The most important element of the operation was that the booze did not have to originate in the country that the tourist was visiting. An American in Canada who ordered five bottles of Johnny Walker would get his package from the bonded warehouse in Amsterdam after sending his customs form to Geneva.
</li><li>Some of the brochures were “politically incorrect” by today’s standards. They had a drawing of a smiling family—mother, father, and child of about ten—with five bottles of liquor stacked in front of each, and the message, “Each family member can order one gallon.” One was illustrated with a sketch of the Eiffel Tower in Paris with the claim that if all the liquor bottles ordered through Tourists International in a year were placed one on top of another, they would reach a height 115 times higher than the tower.
</li><li>By mid-1964, Tourists International was operating in twenty-seven countries and had 200 employees.
</li><li>Thus it was that in midsummer 1965, eight years after founding their company and seeing it expand into one of the world’s first global retailers, Chuck Feeney and Bob Miller faced the perfect storm. The company was buffeted by a series of setbacks: President Johnson’s smashing of the five-pack business, the cutthroat rivalry in the Mediterranean and on the Canadian border, competition in auto sales from the PX stores, the end of the car-sales monopoly in Asia—all combined with bad bookkeeping and extensive overspending to provide a classic example of how an innovative business with a visionary leadership can be sunk.
</li><li>In order to revive its war-shattered economy, the Tokyo government for many years banned ordinary Japanese citizens from traveling outside Japan for pleasure.
</li><li>One hard-as-nails Japanese assistant was so good at selling that the Japanese customers often went out not knowing what they had bought. A customer came back once to complain that the cigars he had bought were difficult to smoke because they had holes in them: Rather than admit they had been eaten by worms, she convinced him that the perforations signified high quality.
</li><li>Japan’s postwar recovery was so successful that by 1968, it was the second-largest free-market economy in the world.
</li><li>A Hong Kong manager suggested the “Chinese cricket attack” to get them to leave, covering a cricket with human excrement and letting it loose in a rival store.
</li><li>He was the decent American, generous, hardworking, and family oriented. Feeney enjoyed his work, he was pleased with his business accomplishments, and he seemed, at first anyway, to be taking some enjoyment from the comfortable life he led. The DFS people loved him. He gave loyalty, and he expected loyalty. He knew the names of every sales assistant and took an interest in their families. He got a reputation for helping staff with problems. When John Monteiro’s eight-year-old son Michael was badly burned after throwing a lit match into a motorcycle gas tank, Feeney had the boy transferred to a first-class hospital in New York for multiple operations and paid all the bills.
</li><li>It only became clear to Danielle afterward how strongly her American husband felt that he did not belong to the world of black-tie dinners and leisure yachts, and how much he was coming to hate ostentation and to despise the life of wealthy socialites in Hong Kong.
</li><li>He was even beginning to have doubts about his right to have so much money. When asked many years later if he was rich at this point in his life, he replied: “How much is rich? Beyond all expectations. Beyond all deserving, so to speak. I just reached the conclusion with myself that money, buying boats and all the trimmings, didn’t appeal to me.” He consciously cultivated a frugal lifestyle, wearing a cheap Timex watch and buying a secondhand Volvo. He insisted that he and his family fly economy class, even on long transoceanic flights, as it was better value for money. He reluctantly attended a few black-tie dinners in Paris and Monte Carlo but when a picture of him and Danielle appeared in Paris Match, he was furious. He stopped attending such events and broke off all connection with the wealthy social group the couple had started to become part of in the south of France.
</li><li>Between 1970 and 1982, criminal and political gangs in Italy carried out 512 kidnappings. He feared that one of his children could end up like Christina Mazzotti, an eighteen-year-old Italian girl who was killed by abductors despite payment of a $2-million ransom in 1975.
</li><li>Although brilliant when talking about business, Feeney was never good at articulating his philosophy of life.
</li><li>Strict rules were formulated for the conduct of the foundation. No solicitations would be entertained. Gifts would be made anonymously, and those who received them would not be told where they came from. The recipients, too, would have to sign confidentiality agreements. If they found out anything about the Atlantic Foundation or Chuck Feeney and made it public, the money would stop. The Atlantic Foundation would be the biggest secret foundation of its size in the world.
</li><li>“I always said, and I was preaching it, the less you speak and the less ostentatious you are, the fewer people who will be angry and jealous,” said Harvey Dale.
</li><li>By 1986, DFS had become the largest retailer of liquor in the world, selling $250 million worth a year.
</li><li>With the fall in DFS sales, Feeney’s rating in the Forbes rich list went down—from $1.9 billion in 1991 to $0.9 billion in 1992. Chuck Rolles had dinner with him in New York on the day the magazine came out with the new list. As they left the restaurant to return to the Cornell Club located twenty-four blocks away, he turned to Feeney and said, “Do you want to walk or take a cab?” “Well,” said Chuck. “Forbes just said I lost a billion in the past year so we’d better walk.” Which is what they did. In fact, in 1991 Feeney was personally worth less than $1 million, according to an audit by his accountants at Price Waterhouse.
</li><li>Most drafts included French philosopher Blaise Pascal’s observation that “noble deeds that are concealed are most esteemed” and American financier Bernard Baruch’s remark that “there’s no limit to what you can accomplish if you don’t care who gets the credit.”
</li><li>“He had become a frugal, self-flagellating philanthropist who craved anonymity, whereas Danielle had a big yacht and a big personality,” said a family intimate.
</li><li>Two years earlier, the pretense of anonymous giving was used to perpetrate the biggest scam in the history of American charities, when the Foundation for New Era Philanthropy, founded by Philadelphia-area Christian businessman John G. Bennett Jr., defrauded donors of $135 million by inviting them to contribute large sums to his foundation for fixed periods that would be matched by secret donors—who did not exist.
</li><li>He told Judith Miller he was prepared to reveal his secret to the world, that he was not a billionaire, as he was usually referred to in the business pages, and that he had long ago given everything, including his DFS shares and his businesses, to his two philanthropic foundations, the Atlantic Foundation and the Atlantic Trust, based in Bermuda. He was personally worth less than $2 million, a fact known only to a tight circle of family and friends. In the last fifteen years he—or rather, his charities—had given $600 million to good causes in the United States and elsewhere across the world. He now planned to set about giving away the remainder—which after the DFS sale amounted to some $3.5 billion.
</li><li>“Money has an attraction for some people, but you can’t wear two pairs of shoes at one time.”
</li><li>“Chuck Feeney,” he wrote in the Daily News, “is what Donald Trump would be if he lived his entire existence backward.”
</li><li>Mark Conroy, too, came to regard Feeney as one of “the best and most thoughtful people” he had ever encountered in his life. “We are all going to be put in a box at the end of the day,” he said. “You can’t really wrap yourself in money. A lot of people think they can. They seek to accumulate wealth. They are pretty aimless. When you come into this kind of work, you don’t think of money except to help people. People say, ‘I have only $200; I’d like to help, but I can’t give like rich people.’ I say to them, ‘You know what, that person with the burned face who benefited from the $200 doesn’t think that way.’ It’s about helping people so that they can help themselves, hoping someday people can get educated and see big enough opportunities to share the planet with each other.”
</li><li>Of the four DFS owners, Alan Parker currently has the most wealth and maintains the lowest profile.
</li><li>“I believe that people of substantial wealth potentially create problems for future generations unless they themselves accept responsibility to use their wealth during their lifetime to help worthwhile causes.”
</li><li>His life is full of paradoxes. He bought some of the finest mansions for his family but wouldn’t live in them. He lives modestly but occasionally stays at one of InterPacific’s five-star resorts. He was the biggest retailer of cigarettes in the world, yet he abhors smoking. He sold luxury goods but would not be seen dead with a Louis Vuitton briefcase. He made his fortune pushing high-end consumer goods yet dislikes Christmas because of its consumerism. The greatest paradox of his life arises from his relationship with money. He loved making money but not having it.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Tuesday, June 14, 2022 2:43:30 PM
</h4><ul><li>I read every book and magazine I could. Heck, three bucks for a magazine, twenty bucks for a book. One good idea would lead to a customer or a solution, and those magazines and books paid for themselves many times over. Some of the ideas I read were good, some not. In doing all the reading I learned a valuable lesson. Everything I read was public. Anyone could buy the same books and magazines. The same information was available to anyone who wanted it. Turns out most people didn’t want it.
</li><li>Every day some stranger somewhere in the world is trying to come up with a way to put you out of business. To take everything you have worked your ass off for, just take it all away. If you are in a growing industry, there could be hundreds or thousands of strangers trying to figure out ways to put you out of business.
</li><li>In sports, the only thing a player can truly control is effort. The same applies to business. The only thing any entrepreneur, salesperson or anyone in any position can control is their effort. I had to kick myself in the ass and recommit to getting up early, staying up late and consuming everything I possibly could to get an edge. I had to commit to making the effort to be as productive as I possibly could. It meant making sure that every hour of the day that I could contact a customer was selling time, and when customers were sleeping, I was doing things that prepared me to make more sales and to make my company better.
</li><li>I’m a big believer that getting married is about finding yourself first, which makes it a lot easier to find the right person. If you can’t stand on your own, it’s impossible to successfully be part of a couple.
</li><li>Never settle. There is no reason to rush. If you aren’t happy with where you are, simplify your life and go out and try as many things as it takes to find what you may be destined to be. If there is such a thing.
</li><li>The point of all this is that it doesn’t matter how many times you fail. It doesn’t matter how many times you almost get it right. No one is going to know or care about your failures, and neither should you. All you have to do is learn from them and from those around you because … All that matters in business is that you get it right once.
</li><li>“Everyone has got the will to win; it’s only those with the will to prepare that do win.”
</li><li>Win the battles you are in first, then worry about expansion internationally or into new businesses.
</li><li>The best businesses in recent entrepreneurial history are those that began with little or no money.
</li><li>It’s as if the missing link for success in a business is cash to get started. It’s not. Far more often than not, raising cash is the biggest mistake you can make.
</li><li>The minute you take money, the leverage completely flips to the investor. They control the destiny of your dreams, not you.
</li><li>There are only two reasonable sources of capital for startup entrepreneurs: your own pocket and your customers’ pockets.
</li><li>Success is about making your life a special version of unique that fits who you are—not what other people want you to be.
</li><li>Make your product easier to buy than your competition, or you will find your customers buying from them, not you.
</li><li>If you don’t have a job, or don’t have the job you want, get a job in sales. Every single person on this planet can learn to be a great salesperson. All you have to do is put in the effort and care about your company, your prospects and customers.
</li><li>It doesn’t matter where you live. It doesn’t matter how you live. It doesn’t matter what kind of car you drive. It doesn’t matter what kind of clothes you wear. It doesn’t matter. Your biggest enemies are your bills. The more you owe, the more you stress. The more you stress over bills, the more difficult it is to focus on your goals. More importantly, if you set your monthly income requirements too high, you eliminate a significant number of opportunities. The cheaper you can live, the greater your options. Remember that.
</li><li>It’s really easy to know if you are in the right job. If it matters how much you get paid, you are not in a job you really love. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t want to make more money. I’m not saying that you shouldn’t bust your ass to make as much money as possible. That’s not the issue. The issue is whether or not you truly love your job. If you love what you do so much that you are willing to continue to live like a student in order to be able to stay in the job, you have found your calling.
</li><li>A great quote from technology luminary Alan Kay that every entrepreneur needs to remember: “The best way to predict the future is to invent it.”

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Tuesday, June 14, 2022 5:43:55 PM
</h4><ul><li>The opportunity that comes with being in a culture other than your own is the disengagement of perspective—you can see more clearly the issues that may be obscured or invisible to you at home.
</li><li>If there is a capitol of world hunger, it is India. There are more chronically malnourished, hungry, and starving people in India than anywhere else on earth,
</li><li>Since success as a beggar depends on getting people to feel shocked or sorry or guilty so they’ll give money, the syndicates and bosses would teach their street beggars ways to make their children look more pitiful. Pressured this way, the parents sometimes did something to scar their child’s face, or they cut off their child’s hand or leg so there would be a stump instead. Families actually mutilated their children to increase their shock value and revenue potential as beggars.
</li><li>The vicious cycle of poverty, she said, has been clearly articulated and is widely known. What is less obvious and goes almost completely unacknowledged is the vicious cycle of wealth. There is no recognition of the trap that wealth so often is, and of the suffering of the wealthy: the loneliness, the isolation, the hardening of the heart, the hunger and poverty of the soul that can come with the burden of wealth. She said that I had extended little or no compassion to the strong, the powerful, and the wealthy, while they need as much compassion as anyone else on earth.
</li><li>Contemporary European author, Bernard Lietaer, former senior officer of the Belgian Central Bank and one of the chief architects of the Euro currency, in his book, Of Human Wealth, says that greed and fear of scarcity are programmed; they do not exist in nature, not even in human nature. They are built into the money system in which we swim, and we’ve been swimming in it so long that these shadows have become almost completely transparent to us.
</li><li>This mind-set of scarcity is not something we intentionally created or have any conscious intention to bring into our life. It was here before us and it will likely persist beyond us, perpetuated in the myths and language of our money culture. We do, however, have a choice about whether or not to buy into it and whether or not to let it rule our lives.
</li><li>In truth, the rush for more distances us from experiencing the deeper value of what we acquire or already have.
</li><li>We have to be willing to let go of that’s just the way it is, even if just for a moment, to consider the possibility that there isn’t a way it is or way it isn’t. There is the way we choose to act and what we choose to make of circumstances.
</li><li>In those events of massive infusions of food aid, time and again, to the point of becoming routine, the food supplies were stolen and resold by the corrupt power brokers who thrive on the greed and graft that is rife in embattled countries. Further, the massive amounts of food aid deflated the local market, meaning that those farmers who did grow grain could no longer sell it because free food was everywhere—at least for a time, as the scramble to hoard and control it played out. The disastrous cycle of aid, corruption, disrupted markets, and disastrous farming investments became part of a problem instead of a solution. The cycle only perpetuated the root causes of the crisis.
</li><li>For the Achuar, wealth means being present to the fullness and richness of the moment and sharing that with one another.
</li><li>These women were completely at the top of their game in their careers and the affluent family lifestyle, but the game they were playing had robbed them of any sense of victory or fulfillment, and the rules of that game were based on the condition of scarcity: They had to get more, more was never enough, and the chase was never ending.
</li><li>When we let go of trying to get more of what we don’t really need, we free up an enormous amount of energy that has been tied up in the chase. We can refocus and reallocate that energy and attention toward appreciating what we already have, what’s already there, and making a difference with that.
</li><li>When we see money as something that flows through our lives and through the world, we realize that it doesn’t really belong to anyone; or we could say it belongs to everyone and the opportunity we have is to allow this resource, just like water, to move through the world in a way that nurtures the most people, and the highest purpose.
</li><li>In Haiti there is a saying—“If you get a piece of cake and eat the whole thing, you will feel empty. If you get a piece of cake and share half of it, you will feel both full and fulfilled.”
</li><li>Listed by the United Nations as the second poorest country in the world in the late 1970s, Bangladesh became the recipient of another kind of flood, a flood of aid, and within a short time had become almost completely dependent on aid from outside sources. Bangladesh began to have a global reputation as needy and helpless, a giant begging bowl of a nation, and within Bangladesh itself, the people came to see themselves that way, too. Bangladeshis had become convinced they were a hopeless, helpless people dependent on others for even minimal survival.
</li><li>By being charitable for those weeks, the affluent world had perhaps done more to relieve its own discomfort about the situation than really addressing the Ethiopians’ situation, and as soon as that crisis was out of fashion, attention and money went elsewhere. The Ethiopians, on the other hand, had learned that they needed to be able to continue to hold up a starving baby to get the attention they desperately needed to keep some form of aid flowing in their direction.
</li><li>Whether it is between nations, or within the smaller space of our own communities or families, when people giving money think of themselves as benevolent saviors, people who are deemed “recipients” cannot establish or distinguish for themselves their worth or their own self-reliance. The benevolent savior misses the vital human experience of healthy interdependence, and the people receiving the money often see themselves as unworthy, instead of the worthy, valuable partners that they could be.
</li><li>According to the Giving USA Annual Report on Philanthropy, in the year 2000 more than $200 billion was given to the not-for-profit sector, and of that $200 billion only 5 percent came from corporations, 7 percent came from foundations. Eighty-eight percent came from individuals. So the bulk of the giving and generosity comes from individuals, and of those people who give 88 percent of the money, 75 percent of them made less than $150,000 a year.
</li><li>We have dreamed it: therefore it is. I have become convinced that everything we think and feel is merely perception: that our lives—individually as well as communally—are molded around such perception: and that if we want to change, we must alter our perception. When we give our energy to a different dream, the world is transformed. To create a new world, we must first create a new dream. —JOHN PERKINS, The World Is As You Dream It
</li><li>Buckminster Fuller said, “everyone has the perfect gift to give the world—and if each of us is freed up to give the gift that is uniquely ours to give, the world will be in total harmony.”
</li><li>When you take a stand, it gives you authenticity, power, and clarity. You find your place in the universe, and you have the capacity to move the world.
</li><li>One of the great dynamics of money is that it grounds us, and when we put money behind our commitments it grounds them, too, making them real in the world. We can wish for better schools, a clean environment, and world peace; we can even volunteer, but when we also put our money behind those intentions, we become really serious about them. Money is a great translator of intention to reality, vision to fulfillment.
</li><li>Words do not label things already there. Words are like the knife of a carver: They free the idea, the thing, from the general formlessness of the outside. As a man speaks, not only is his language in a state of birth, but also the very thing about which he is talking. —INUIT WISDOM
</li><li>Experience has taught me that it is also true that the words we say create our thoughts and our experience, and even our world. The conversation we have with ourselves and with others—the thoughts that grip our attention—has enormous power over how we feel, what we experience, and how we see the world in that moment.
</li><li>His Holiness the Dalai Lama, in his book Ethics for the New Millennium, shares the wisdom of the Indian scholar Shantideva who once observed that while “we have no hope of finding enough leather to cover the earth so that we never prick our feet on a thorn, actually we do not need to. Enough to cover the soles of our feet will suffice.”
</li><li>In Sub-Saharan Africa alone, 85 percent of the food farmers are women, but their work is unrecognized. It is given no monetary value.
</li><li>Then Bucky said something that changed my life and my relationship with my children forever. He said to Bill and me, “Remember, your children are your elders in universe time. They have come into a more complete, more evolved universe than you or I can know. We can only see that universe through their eyes.”

</h4><ul><li>In general, when you hear someone invoking abstract modernistic notions, you can assume that they got some education (but not enough, or in the wrong discipline) and have too little accountability.
</li><li>We saw that interventionistas don’t learn because they are not the victims of their mistakes, and, as we hinted at with pathemata mathemata: The same mechanism of transferring risk also impedes learning.
</li><li>You will never fully convince someone that he is wrong; only reality can.
</li><li>Hammurabi’s best known injunction is as follows: “If a builder builds a house and the house collapses and causes the death of the owner of the house—the builder shall be put to death.”
</li><li>Universal behavior is great on paper, disastrous in practice.
</li><li>Avoid taking advice from someone who gives advice for a living, unless there is a penalty for their advice.
</li><li>Anything you do to optimize your work, cut some corners, or squeeze more “efficiency” out of it (and out of your life) will eventually make you dislike it.
</li><li>Society doesn’t evolve by consensus, voting, majority, committees, verbose meetings, academic conferences, tea and cucumber sandwiches, or polling; only a few people suffice to disproportionately move the needle.
</li><li>The average behavior of the market participant will not allow us to understand the general behavior of the market.
</li><li>There is a trader’s expression: “Never buy when you can rent the three Fs: what you Float, what you Fly, and what you…(that something else).”
</li><li>What matters isn’t what a person has or doesn’t have; it is what he or she is afraid of losing.
</li><li>Thirty-nine percent of Americans will spend a year in the top 5 percent of the income distribution, 56 percent will find themselves in the top 10 percent, and 73 percent will spend a year in the top 20 percent.
</li><li>You can define a free person precisely as someone whose fate is not centrally or directly dependent on peer assessment.
</li><li>The reason science works isn’t because there is a proper “scientific method” derived by some nerds in isolation, or some “standard” that passes a test similar to the eye exam of the Department of Motor Vehicles; rather it is because scientific ideas are Lindy-prone, that is, subjected to their own natural fragility.
</li><li>If you hear advice from a grandmother or elders, odds are that it works 90 percent of the time.
</li><li>A former trader who invests in the restaurant business, Brian Hinchcliffe, conveyed to me the following heuristic: Shops that get awards as “The Best” something (best atmosphere, best waiter service, best fermented yoghurt and other nonalcoholic beverages for visiting Sheikhs, etc.) close down before the awards ceremony. Empirically, if you want an author to cross a few generations, make sure he or she never gets that something called the Nobel Prize in Literature.
</li><li>Simply the one who doesn’t look the part, conditional on having made a (sort of) successful career in his profession, had to have much to overcome in terms of perception. And if we are lucky enough to have people who do not look the part, it is thanks to the presence of some skin in the game, the contact with reality that filters out incompetence, as reality is blind to looks.
</li><li>In any type of activity or business divorced from the direct filter of skin in the game, the great majority of people know the jargon, play the part, and are intimate with the cosmetic details, but are clueless about the subject.
</li><li>Simply consider that close to 80 or 85 percent of the cost of a tomato can be attributed to transportation, storage, and waste (unsold inventories), rather than the cost at the farmer level.
</li><li>To put it another way: if wealth is giving you fewer options instead of more (and more varied) options, you’re doing it wrong.
</li><li>Today, anonymity brings out the a**hole in people. So I accidentally discovered a way to change the behavior of unethical and abusive persons without verbal threat. Take their pictures. Just the act of taking their pictures is similar to holding their lives in your hands and controlling their future behavior thanks to your silence. They don’t know what you can do with it, and will live in a state of uncertainty.
</li><li>Courage is the only virtue you cannot fake.
</li><li>Finally, when young people who “want to help mankind” come to me asking, “What should I do? I want to reduce poverty, save the world,” and similar noble aspirations at the macro-level, my suggestion is: 1)  Never engage in virtue signaling; 2)  Never engage in rent-seeking; 3)  You must start a business. Put yourself on the line, start a business.
</li><li>No peace proceeds from bureaucratic ink. If you want peace, make people trade, as they have done for millennia. They will be eventually forced to work something out.
</li><li>As the reader will know by now, I have myself lived through the worst part of the civil war in Lebanon. Except for areas near the Green Line, it didn’t feel like war.
</li><li>The only definition of rationality that I’ve found that is practically, empirically, and mathematically rigorous is the following: what is rational is that which allows for survival. Unlike modern theories by psychosophasters, it maps to the classical way of thinking. Anything that hinders one’s survival at an individual, collective, tribal, or general level is, to me, irrational.
</li><li>Not everything that happens happens for a reason, but everything that survives survives for a reason.
</li><li>In a strategy that entails ruin, benefits never offset risks of ruin.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Saturday, June 18, 2022 1:41:36 PM
</h4><ul><li>“Don’t be silly, Ree. Nothing in life is that complicated. You can do whatever you set your mind to if you just roll up your sleeves, get in there, and do it. Everything is figureoutable.”
</li><li>No matter what you’re facing, you have what it takes to figure anything out and become the person you’re meant to be.
</li><li>As a species, we choose to spend more money each year on ice cream—a whopping $59 billion—rather than provide the basic human dignities of education, health care, and sanitation to all humans on earth, for a mere $28 billion.
</li><li>The next time you hear yourself thinking or saying, “I know this already,” especially as you read this book, immediately catch that thought and switch to a growth-minded question. Ask yourself, “What can I learn from this?”
</li><li>Rule 1. All problems (or dreams) are figureoutable.
</li><li>Rule 2. If a problem is not figureoutable, it’s not really a problem—it’s a fact of life or law of nature (e.g., death or gravity).
</li><li>Rule 3. You may not care enough to figure this problem out or achieve this particular dream. That’s okay. Find another problem or dream that ignites a blazing fire in your heart and go back to Rule 1.
</li><li>Nothing in this book will work unless you do. Experiment with the ideas, suggestions, and action challenges for at least thirty days.
</li><li>Do you realize that virtually everything that surrounds us was once only a thought? An idea? A wild, formless figment of someone’s imagination?
</li><li>But one thing is certain. If you don’t believe something is possible for you, it’s not. Period. End of story. The moment you tell your brain, “That’s not possible” or “I can’t” or “That will never work for me,” you’re 100 percent right. You command your brain to shut down. The mind and body will follow.
</li><li>Test scores and measures of achievement tell you where a student is, but they don’t tell you where a student could end up.
</li><li>Many of our most deeply held convictions are hand-me-downs. They’re old, unexamined, and unquestioned ideas that we innocently accepted from others.
</li><li>Finding role models outside your immediate circle is one of the best and most powerful ways to transcend your own limiting beliefs. Alive or dead, famous or unknown, find inspiring examples through reading biographies, watching movies, listening to interviews, or simply paying closer attention to good people in your life.
</li><li>The most powerful words in the universe are the words you say to yourself.
</li><li>Here’s the problem: 99 percent of the time when we say we “can’t” do something, “can’t” is a euphemism for “won’t.” What does “won’t” mean? “Won’t” means we’re not willing.
</li><li>“Life is 10 percent what happens to me and 90 percent how I react to it.”
</li><li>Seek out stories of people who can become touchstones for your mental and emotional strength. People whose stories of relentless heart and determination inspire you to dig deeper and keep going.
</li><li>There are two kinds of people in the world: those with reasons and those with results.
</li><li>Research has proven that roughly 40 percent of our daily activities are habitual. Which means we humans spend a significant portion of our existence on autopilot with no awareness of what the hell we’re doing when we’re doing it.
</li><li>What stops you is never external. Ever. It’s never about the lack of money or time or anything else. It’s about your internal game, your commitment to do whatever it takes to be creative, get resourceful, and figure it out. To find or make a way ahead, no matter what.
</li><li>Fear is not the enemy. Waiting to stop feeling afraid is.
</li><li>Doing the thing is far easier than the terror we inflict upon ourselves by stressing over it in our heads.
</li><li>In his game-changing book The War of Art, Steven Pressfield writes: The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we have to do it . . . Therefore the more fear we feel about a specific enterprise, the more certain we can be that that enterprise is important to us and to the growth of our soul.
</li><li>I win or I learn, but I never lose.
</li><li>“Failure is just an event. It is not a characteristic. People can’t be failures.”
</li><li>Clarity comes from engagement, not thought.
</li><li>When you’re stuck in a paralyzing thought loop of indecision, stop thinking and start doing. Make a move, no matter how tiny. Find (or make) a way to do a real-world experiment. Action is the fastest and most direct route to clarity.
</li><li>When you make a clear, committed decision about something you want, it’s analogous to picking up the phone and placing a to-go order with the cosmos.
</li><li>Never, ever forget that everyone struggles. I mean everyone. My career has afforded me a front row seat to some of the most creative, accomplished people on the planet. Regardless of wealth, fame, or perceived power, every single individual is fighting their own private battles. We all have our vulnerabilities and insecurities. Money is wonderful. But it doesn’t solve all problems. Humans need meaningful projects to work on. We need strong, loving relationships. We need a reason to get up in the morning. We need to connect and contribute. Otherwise, we get destructive. Don’t believe me? Read up on the nightmare lives and suicides of lottery winners. Then check out how many retirees die soon after they stop working, or get so bored and depressed that they reenter the workforce.
</li><li>There are two types of pain you will go through in life: the pain of discipline and the pain of regret. Discipline weighs ounces, while regret weighs tons.
</li><li>You must disobey the voice in your head that says, I’m not ready yet.
</li><li>Starting small and sucky beats staying stucky.
</li><li>Elizabeth Gilbert, author of the pop culture juggernaut Eat, Pray, Love, as well as seven other books so far, told me she didn’t make a dime off her writing for the first ten years. Then, for the next ten years (which were after already having three books published), she still relied on various jobs outside writing to stay afloat.
</li><li>If you’re not willing to work your ass off over an extended period of time (I’m talking years, not months), then be honest with yourself: that dream isn’t really that important to you. That’s okay. Drop it. Dig deeper. Find something you are willing to stick with and work for, no matter how long it takes.
</li><li>Sometimes, figuring things out requires that you refuse to be refused. Just because someone else—a parent, teacher, critic, friend, loved one, flight attendant, coworker, boss, culture, or society—says, “No, you can’t” or “No, that’s not possible” or “No, that’s not how it’s done around here,” doesn’t mean you must agree with their version of reality.
</li><li>If you don’t risk anything, you risk even more.
</li><li>Haters are confused admirers who can’t understand why everybody else likes you.
</li><li>It’s not your job to like me, it’s mine.
</li><li>GOLDEN RULE: Never reply when angry, emotional, or buzzed.
</li><li>If your dreams are only about personal gain—fame, money, or power— you’ll eventually run out of steam. Even if you do manage to reach your goal, the win will feel shallow. You’ll wonder, Is that it? Is this really all there is?
</li><li>There is a vitality, a life force, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all time, this expression is unique, and if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium, and be lost. The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is, not how it compares with other expression. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel open.
</li><li>No matter how many times you think an idea or creation has been shared in the world, sometimes it takes that one person expressing it in their unique voice, at the right time, in the right place, for it to actually make a difference.
</li><li>Remember, you are a onetime mega event in the universe. Don’t fucking waste it.
</li><li>If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you.
</li><li>Please, for the love of all things holy, do what you dream of now so you’ll never regret not having tried.
</li><li>Promise yourself that from this moment forward, you won’t waste one more minute of one more day saying, “I don’t know how to do that.” Or “I don’t know if I have what it takes to become that.”
</li><li>If you want the best chance to figure out your dreams, build a nourishing environment around you. Make it a priority to strengthen your social connections. Invest in others by caring and supporting their ability to figure out their dreams, too.
</li><li>In fact, loneliness is as lethal as smoking fifteen cigarettes a day.
</li><li>study by the Association for Talent Development found that you’ve got a 65 percent chance of completing a goal if you commit to someone. Add a specific accountability appointment and you’ll increase your chances of success by up to 95 percent.

</h4><ul><li>It’s one of my theories that when people give you advice, they’re really just talking to themselves in the past.
</li><li>How does an artist look at the world? First, you figure out what’s worth stealing, then you move on to the next thing. That’s about all there is to it.

</li><li>There’s no pressure when you’re unknown. You can do what you want. Experiment. Do things just for the fun of it. When you’re unknown, there’s nothing to distract you from getting better. No public image to manage. No huge paycheck on the line. No stockholders. No e-mails from your agent.
</li><li>I’d say that 90 percent of my mentors and peers don’t live in Austin, Texas. They live everywhere. I know them from the Internet.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Tuesday, June 21, 2022 5:40:47 PM
</h4><ul><li>     Each person will act in keeping with his own identity. This means he'll be bound by the limits of his own knowledge and experience—even if he wishes he weren't. To expect him to act otherwise is to fall into the Identity Trap and hope for something that can't be.
</li><li>     A free man spends most of his time making positive decisions—choosing among attractive alternatives.      Most people, however, spend most of their time making negative decisions—deciding which alternatives would be the least unpleasant, trying to keep things from getting worse. As time passes, such a person settles for less and less, believing that it isn't possible to be free and profoundly happy.
</li><li>To try to find happiness by doing what seems to make others happy is to fall head first into the Identity Trap.
</li><li>     No cosmic judge has declared, "Thou shalt be a good son," or "Thou shalt be a successful businessman," or "Thou shalt be a good wife and mother." You have chosen, perhaps carelessly, the identities you try to live up to.
</li><li>     Each individual seeks happiness for himself in the way that his knowledge and perception indicate to him. He isn't you; don't expect him to be.
</li><li>          TO BECOME FREE requires a well-conceived plan of action. It can't be achieved by occasional spur-of-the-moment hunches. To be free, you must know what you're doing and why. Otherwise, slight setbacks can cause you to discard your plans and give up.
</li><li>     Your emotions can also be signals that it's time to re-examine your existing values. Perhaps they're alerting you that you've inadvertently moved away from your own best interests.
</li><li>     His ideas have worked for him because he's been wise enough to develop ideas that are consistent with his own nature. He hasn't tried to live by the standards created by others; he's found his own. And that's vitally important.
</li><li>     Suppose you use a holy book as your guide. I haven't yet seen one that doesn't have some apparent contradictions regarding conduct in it. Those contradictions may disappear with the proper interpretation; but who provides the interpretation? You'll do it yourself or you'll select someone to provide it for you. In either case, you have become the authority by making the choice.
</li><li>Too often, morality is used merely as a tool by which one person hopes to manipulate another.
</li><li>To assume that someone once wrote down the final answers for your morality is to assume that the writer stopped growing the day he wrote the code. Don't treat him unfairly by thinking that he couldn't have discovered more and increased his own understanding after he'd written the code. And don't forget that what he wrote was based upon what he saw.
</li><li>The unselfishness concept is a merry-go-round that has no ultimate purpose. No one's self-interest is enhanced by the continual relaying of gifts from one person to another to another.
</li><li>     And when someone accuses you of being selfish, just remember that he's upset only because you aren't doing what he selfishly wants you to do.
</li><li>     The Group Trap is the assumption that greater strength can be achieved by sharing. Just the opposite happens: Individual objectives are watered down, time and effort are wasted in arranging compromises, and individual incentive is reduced.      The individual becomes much less flexible and mobile, because he must deal with others before getting on with the task at hand. As Thoreau said, "The man who goes alone can start today; but he who travels with another must wait till that other is ready."
</li><li>     The most successful salesmen, consciously or intuitively, recognize and accept the identities of the people they deal with. They take seriously their prospects' attitudes and objections. And they don't waste their time with inappropriate prospects. Because they realize that they can't sell everyone, they're more selective in picking the people they'll try to sell.
</li><li>     There are also wide differences in tastes and desires. This, too is fortunate. For these differences make the world orderly. If everyone wanted the same things, we would all be struggling against each other to acquire what little was available.
</li><li>     For example, the U.S. News & World Report claims that the total yearly take from organized crime is $19.7 billion.10 But a closer look at the figures indicates that less than a billion dollars of that is in crimes of violence. Over 90% of the total is in two-sided transactions like gambling, loan-sharking, alcohol, prostitution, and drugs. You can simply decline to participate in any of that.
</li><li>     It's popularly assumed that you have a right to your life. Unfortunately however, if someone kills you, your right is of little value.
</li><li>     It's more realistic, and far less trying, simply to allow each person to be what he wants to be, while you look for people who already are what you want them to be.
</li><li>     Large social changes take place only when the market is ready—meaning, when millions of individuals are ready for such change. No matter who was leading the movement, great social changes have occurred only when the market was ready for them.
</li><li>When I remember how many of my private schemes have miscarried; how speculations have failed, agents proved dishonest, marriage been a disappointment; how I did but pauperize the relative I sought to help; how my carefully governed son has turned out worse than most children; how the thing I desperately strove against as a misfortune did me immense good; how while the objects I ardently pursued brought me little happiness when gained, most of my pleasures have come from unexpected sources; when I recall these and hosts of like facts, I am struck with the incompetence of my intellect to prescribe for society. —HERBERT SPENCER
</li><li>With what you have now, what is the best way to use that to get the most in the future? What you've paid to get to where you are now is irrelevant; those resources are gone and can't be retrieved, no matter what you do.
</li><li>     A key to good decision-making is the ability to recognize what you're giving up when you choose something.
</li><li>     I've never found an exception to the rule that the sooner you pay a price, the less it costs you. As long as a situation continues, you pay a price just knowing that the situation is unresolved. And the longer a situation continues, the firmer other people become in their attitude that you have no right to initiate a change.
</li><li>When people won't let you alone, it's because you haven't learned how to make them do it. —DAVID SEABURY
</li><li>It's easy to forget that what we accept as certain knowledge from others is subject to the human limitations of perception and logic. No one can be expected to know everything, to see everything with unfailing accuracy, and to interpret what he sees with perfect judgment.
</li><li>     I find that when I integrate everything I see around two basic principles, it all makes perfect sense: (1) Each person seeks his own mental well-being (happiness); and (2) Everything that happens is the effect of a prior cause.
</li><li>     The gigantic myth called "society" that rules so many lives doesn't even exist. "Society" is merely a collection of different people, tastes, and judgments. It can't enforce its rules upon you.
</li><li>     If you want to find someone who is much like yourself in attitude, tastes, and interests, you have to look where such a person is likely to be found. And you can't expect him to recognize you if you hide your identity behind a mask in order to get along with the people you're with.
</li><li>What you are is the most valuable asset you possess for finding others.      And the best way to find those people is to advertise what you really are.
</li><li>     Don't make the relationship an end in itself that must be perpetuated at all costs. That will lead to demands for sacrifices in the name of "making our marriage work," "keeping our friendship," or "making the business succeed."
</li><li>Why so many people think a happy marriage is based upon sacrifice, I'll never know. Life is to be lived, not sacrificed. You love someone because of the way he makes you feel, because of the way he enhances your life. If what you are doesn't do the same for him, no amount of sacrifice is going to make things right.
</li><li>Too often, jealousy smolders and grows because it's suppressed or denied and the discomfort is attributed to something else.
</li><li>For close to two decades, most people are led to believe that they aren't sovereign.      Then, suddenly, they're thrust out into the world and expected to make far-reaching decisions concerning their lives. It's no wonder that they have difficulty foreseeing the consequences of their actions and fall back on any authority that appears to be competent to make decisions for them.
</li><li>     Whatever your parents did "for you" was actually what they did for themselves. They took a calculated risk that the time, effort, and money they expended would produce a child they would enjoy, and they hoped it would lead you to a life they would consider favorable to them. If you choose not to live that kind of life, they lose on that part of their investment.
</li><li>     When you pay for results, not for time, you get three important benefits: (1) you have an accurate understanding of what each thing costs you (and can easily compare alternatives); (2) you no longer have to supervise the individual's time—all you have to do is check his results; and (3) each supplier has the same incentive you do with regard to his service—he'll profit most by doing what is most valuable to you.
</li><li>     You can have so much more if you recognize your own sovereignty. In the final analysis, the only person who can exploit you is you—because you make all the final decisions for your life.
</li><li>     There's always something you can do. And usually the way to find out what you can do is to ask.
</li><li>     You need time alone to act completely on your own desires—to discover the kinds of entertainment that please you, to realize such things as what color you'd most like your living room to be, to daydream and discover what you're now missing. Your desires will be best learned when there's no one around to influence and inhibit you.
</li><li>     Until you're sure what you want for the long term, you can continue to live day by day, enjoying what you experience, experimenting with new things. You don't have to decide upon a career by any given age; nor do you have to know right now what you want most in a long-term love relationship. And there's no reason to commit your future before you know those things.
</li><li>     I've always found it hard to understand why so many people live so much for the future—especially when the present is such a lovely place.
</li><li>     Make sure that every week has a specified time that's totally unplanned. Reserve that time so that you can decide—when it arrives—how you'll use it. Don't use it to catch up on unfinished business; use it to enjoy yourself, to do what you want most to do at that moment.
</li><li>     When you've accomplished that, arrange things so that every day has such a period of unplanned time. Make your life meaningful and tasty by enjoying happiness every day.
</li><li>The worst thing one can do is not to try, to be aware of what one wants and not give in to it, to spend years in silent hurt wondering if something could have materialized—and never knowing. —DAVID S. VISCOTT
</li><li>     No matter how complicated your life has become, there's a way to unravel it. No matter how many boxes you may be in, there's always a way to pay a price and get out. No matter how alienated you may feel in your environment, there's always a way to find more compatible people.
</li><li>You can't be free by acting on a whim or on someone's advice; you have to be sure you know what you're doing.
</li><li>     The strongest emotional pressure will be encouragement to turn back in order to avoid paying the price. Don't do it. Keep reminding yourself what you're paying for. Remember that you won't make things better by turning back now. Things will never be the same as they were once; the only way to better them is to continue forward to where you've decided to go.
</li><li>     It's amazing how many mysteries of life can be dissolved just by asking questions.
</li><li>     Neither do I have to worry whether anyone is "getting away" with anything. I'm not the world's policeman. I know that everyone will experience the consequences of his own acts. If his acts are right, he'll get good consequences; if they're not, he'll suffer for it. The consequences are the only standard that matters—and I'm certainly not needed to impose those consequences.
</li><li>     We'll probably never meet, but I want you to know that I'm on your side.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Saturday, June 25, 2022 12:42:45 AM
</h4><ul><li>Bargaining with the Devil: When to Negotiate, When to Fight.1
</li><li>“How am I supposed to do that?”
</li><li>While I wasn’t actually saying “No,” the questions I kept asking sounded like it. They seemed to insinuate that the other side was being dishonest and unfair. And that was enough to make them falter and negotiate with themselves.
</li><li>“I’m just asking questions,” I said. “It’s a passive-aggressive approach. I just ask the same three or four open-ended questions over and over and over and over. They get worn out answering and give me everything I want.”
</li><li>The United States was experiencing an epidemic of airline hijackings at the time; there were five in one three-day period in 1970.
</li><li>Their system was easy to follow and seductive, with four basic tenets. One, separate the person—the emotion—from the problem; two, don’t get wrapped up in the other side’s position (what they’re asking for) but instead focus on their interests (why they’re asking for it) so that you can find what they really want; three, work cooperatively to generate win-win options; and, four, establish mutually agreed-upon standards for evaluating those possible solutions.
</li><li>Psychotherapy research shows that when individuals feel listened to, they tend to listen to themselves more carefully and to openly evaluate and clarify their own thoughts and feelings. In addition, they tend to become less defensive and oppositional and more willing to listen to other points of view, which gets them to the calm and logical place where they can be good Getting to Yes problem solvers.
</li><li>Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. If we’re too much in a hurry, people can feel as if they’re not being heard and we risk undermining the rapport and trust we’ve built. There’s plenty of research that now validates the passage of time as one of the most important tools for a negotiator.
</li><li>There are essentially three voice tones available to negotiators: the late-night FM DJ voice, the positive/playful voice, and the direct or assertive voice.
</li><li>It’s almost laughably simple: for the FBI, a “mirror” is when you repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said. Of the entirety of the FBI’s hostage negotiation skill set, mirroring is the closest one gets to a Jedi mind trick. Simple, and yet uncannily effective.
</li><li>The seventh-largest standing army in the world was at the ready outside the bank doors—that’s the size and scope of the NYPD,
</li><li>Every time you mirror someone, they will reword what they’ve said. They will never say it exactly the same way they said it the first time. Ask someone, “What do you mean by that?” and you’re likely to incite irritation or defensiveness. A mirror, however, will get you the clarity you want while signaling respect and concern for what the other person is saying.
</li><li>I’ve found the phrase “Look, I’m an asshole” to be an amazingly effective way to make problems go away.
</li><li>Research shows that the best way to deal with negativity is to observe it, without reaction and without judgment. Then consciously label each negative feeling and replace it with positive, compassionate, and solution-based thoughts.
</li><li>A trap into which many fall is to take what other people say literally. I started to see that while people played the game of conversation, it was in the game beneath the game, where few played, that all the leverage lived.
</li><li>Though the intensity may differ from person to person, you can be sure that everyone you meet is driven by two primal urges: the need to feel safe and secure, and the need to feel in control. If you satisfy those drives, you’re in the door.
</li><li>Persuasion is not about how bright or smooth or forceful you are. It’s about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea.
</li><li>As you’ll soon learn, the sweetest two words in any negotiation are actually “That’s right.”
</li><li>In the lawless, chaotic wake of the 2004 rebellion that toppled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haiti surpassed Colombia as the kidnap capital of the Americas. In fact, with between eight and ten people abducted every day in the Caribbean nation of eight million, Haiti earned the dubious honor of having the highest kidnapping rate in the world.
</li><li>So you pay the ransom and they release your relative, right? Wrong. There’s always leverage. Negotiation is never a linear formula: add X to Y to get Z. We all have irrational blind spots, hidden needs, and undeveloped notions.
</li><li>Deadlines regularly make people say and do impulsive things that are against their best interests, because we all have a natural tendency to rush as a deadline approaches.
</li><li>The mantra we coach our clients on is, “No deal is better than a bad deal.” If that mantra can truly be internalized, and clients begin to believe they’ve got all the time they need to conduct the negotiation right, their patience becomes a formidable weapon.
</li><li>Moore discovered that when negotiators tell their counterparts about their deadline, they get better deals. It’s true. First, by revealing your cutoff you reduce the risk of impasse. And second, when an opponent knows your deadline, he’ll get to the real deal- and concession-making more quickly.
</li><li>In Descartes’ Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain,2 neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explained a groundbreaking discovery he made. Studying people who had damage in the part of the brain where emotions are generated, he found that they all had something peculiar in common: They couldn’t make decisions. They could describe what they should do in logical terms, but they found it impossible to make even the simplest choice.

</li><li>In a recent study,4 Columbia Business School psychologists found that job applicants who named a range received significantly higher overall salaries than those who offered a number, especially if their range was a “bolstering range,” in which the low number in the range was what they actually wanted.
</li><li>Kevin Dutton says in his book Split-Second Persuasion.1
</li><li>The basic issue here is that when people feel that they are not in control, they adopt what psychologists call a hostage mentality. That is, in moments of conflict they react to their lack of power by either becoming extremely defensive or lashing out.
</li><li>■   Don’t ask questions that start with “Why” unless you want your counterpart to defend a goal that serves you. “Why” is always an accusation, in any language.

</h4><ul><li>Google gives its engineers “20 percent time”: they can work on whatever project they want for 20 percent of their time. More than half of the products and projects Google releases were created during this 20 percent time.
</li><li>According to a study from Upwork, freelancing now accounts for more than one-third of jobs in America.
</li><li>When I asked Danielle LaPorte if she’d take funding again for a new business idea, she said no. She’d learned that not accepting outside funding allowed her to move faster. Instead, she said, she would quickly release a first version of a new product that would fund iterations on it, keeping her costs and expenses as low as possible in order to move toward profitability as quickly as possible. The fewer staff and less external funding involved, the faster a company can move, whether forward or in a new, more promising direction.
</li><li>If you have an idea for starting a business that requires a lot of money, time, or resources, you’re most likely thinking too big.
</li><li>A study done by the Startup Genome Project, which analyzed more than 3,200 high-growth tech startups, found that 74 percent of those businesses failed, not because of competition or bad business plans, but because they scaled up too quickly.
</li><li>When the Kauffman Foundation and Inc. magazine did a follow-up study on a list of the 5,000 fastest-growing companies five to eight years later, they found that more than two-thirds of them were out of business, had undergone massive layoffs, or had been sold below their market value, confirming the findings of the Startup Genome Project.
</li><li>The Kauffman Foundation study also illustrated that almost 86 percent of companies that succeeded in the long term did not take VC money.
</li><li>Instead of scaling production, she focused on raising her prices higher and higher until the demand leveled off to where she could handle orders.
</li><li>The Census Bureau data shows that each year it becomes easier and less risky to work for yourself and still make a decent living.
</li><li>Envy is also based on a false comparison, like comparing uncooked ingredients to a delicious baked pie. Envying others, we see only the end result or the final product—the delicious dessert. But in ourselves, we see all the not-so-tasty starting ingredients and are aware of all the real work required to combine them into a successful end product.
</li><li>But there is one way that envy can be useful: as a tool to recognize in ourselves what we truly value. For example, if I’m envious that you make more money than I do, then I need to recognize that making more money might be important to me, work toward figuring out if that’s truly the case, and then, if it is, determine how I can best make more of it.
</li><li>Interestingly, Oates found that hustlers don’t outperform nonhustlers; the only noticeable impact of their hustling is higher job stress, greater work-life conflict, and deteriorating health. His research found no relationship between workaholism and greater financial reward or self-efficacy.
</li><li>Rand’s first insight is that self-awareness is an absolute requirement. By fostering the ability to notice things about yourself—your own depression, for example—you can remove or put into remission the so-called power tumor. The more you get to know yourself, what your triggers are, and what personally drives you outside of external motivation, the more you can optimize a healthy role for yourself as a leader.
</li><li>Research from William MacAskill of Oxford University has shown that engaging work helps you develop passion, not the other way around. This kind of work draws you in, holds your attention, and gives you a sense of flow (being absorbed in the work and losing track of time). Engaging work comprises four key components: clearly defined assignments, tasks you excel at, performance feedback, and work autonomy.
</li><li>Opportunities are just obligations wearing an appealing mask. There might be a positive outcome to seizing them, but they always come at a cost—in terms of time, attention, or resources.
</li><li>If we try to appeal to everyone, we won’t appeal to anyone in particular, muddying our message. Creating indifference or simply being another boring small company in a crowded marketplace just won’t serve you well as a company of one. The “poster child” for polarization is Marmite, the classic yeast food spread from the United Kingdom. Marmite’s tagline is “You either love it or hate it,” a message it’s been tapping successfully for twenty years. Guy Kawasaki, the well-known marketing specialist and venture capitalist, also thinks that we shouldn’t be afraid of polarization. Large companies search for the “Holy Grail” of products that appeal to every demographic, socioeconomic background, and geographical location, but this “one size fits all” approach rarely works and often leads to mediocrity (and vanilla ice cream). Instead, Kawasaki believes, we should create products that make specifically identified groups of people very happy and ignore everyone else. The worst-case scenario is inciting no passionate reactions from anyone—no one caring enough about a product to talk about it at all, either positively or negatively. The idea that we should be able to infinitely scale attention for what we create to everyone can quickly become our downfall—the same kind of downfall waiting for those startups that attempt to infinitely scale customers and staff much too quickly. Expanding too quickly and for too large an audience often spells doom. Being unique, different, and unusual can have a polarizing effect on your potential audience.

</li><li>In my own business, email marketing accounts for more than 93 percent of revenue each year.
</li><li>Decisions should be made with a focus on realized profit, not based on the expectation that profit may happen. This is such a key and main difference in how growth-focused businesses and companies of one operate. Even when a company of one needs to grow, that can happen only if metrics are based on actual profit, not on hopeful profit projections.

</li><li>Richard Foster, a lecturer at the Yale School of Management, found that the average life span of a business on the S&P 500 is only fifteen years total.
</li><li>There’s only one rule for being a company of one: stay attentive to those opportunities that require growth and question them before taking them. That’s it—one rule. The rest is entirely up to you. But if you ever stop questioning the need for growth, you run the risk that the beast of growth will devour you and your business whole.

</li><li>So many people would rather be disappointed and unfulfilled doing things that are safe than go through the anxiety of chasing valuable dreams and goals.
</li><li>“What man really fears is not so much extinction, but extinction with insignificance. Man wants to know that his life has somehow counted, if not for himself, then at least in a larger scheme of things, that it has left a trace, a trace that has meaning.”
</li><li>Back in 1962, Victor and Mildred Goertzel wrote a book called Cradles of Eminence, in which they investigated the life stories of more than four hundred high-achieving people, including Louis Armstrong, Frida Kahlo, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Henry Ford. The book is still cited today for its key findings: 75 percent of the Goertzels’ subjects “had grown up in a family burdened by a severe problem: poverty, abuse, absent parents, alcoholism, serious illness or some other misfortune.”
</li><li>Psychiatrist and philosopher Viktor Frankl said, “Happiness…cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself.”
</li><li>87 percent of millionaires would not say they are wealthy.

</li><li>To carry this even further and put your financial circumstance into perspective, if your family of four makes $50,000 a year, you’re in the top 10.6 percent of people on the planet for income.
</li><li>If you’re stressed about money (which is apparently 70 percent of us), the quickest way to alleviate that stress and change your outlook is to give some money away—literally the opposite of what you’ve been trying in the past.
</li><li>‘I have come to realize that materialism holds people captive in many of the same ways communism does. The communism I grew up with sought to destroy our personal identities by force. Materialism does the same. But materialism destroys personal identity by choice.’

</li><li>Leisure makes a great booster to long-term productivity in our pursuit of meaningful goals. But leisure makes a terrible goal in itself.
</li><li>Historians say that Otto von Bismarck, chancellor of Germany, had a hand in inventing the modern concept of retirement in 1883 when he offered a pension to any nonworking German over the age of seventy, which was lowered to sixty-five a few years later.

</li><li>For Rabih, the most attractive people aren’t those who accept him right away (he doubts their judgment) or those who never give him a chance (he grows to resent their indifference) but rather those who, for unfathomable reasons—perhaps a competing romantic entanglement or a cautious nature, a physical predicament or a psychological inhibition, a religious commitment or a political objection—leave him turning for a little while in the wind.
</li><li>Without patience for negotiation, there is bitterness: anger that forgot where it came from. There is a nagger who wants it done now and can’t be bothered to explain why. And there is a naggee who no longer has the heart to explain that his or her resistance is grounded in some sensible counterarguments or, alternatively, in some touching and perhaps even forgivable flaws of character. The two parties just hope the problems—so boring to them both—will simply go away.
</li><li>The sulker may be six foot one and holding down adult employment, but the real message is poignantly retrogressive: “Deep inside, I remain an infant, and right now I need you to be my parent. I need you correctly to guess what is truly ailing me, as people did when I was a baby, when my ideas of love were first formed.”
</li><li>We do our sulking lovers the greatest possible favor when we are able to regard their tantrums as we would those of an infant. We are so alive to the idea that it’s patronizing to be thought of as younger than we are; we forget that it is also, at times, the greatest privilege for someone to look beyond our adult self in order to engage with—and forgive—the disappointed, furious, inarticulate child within.
</li><li>We learn, too, that being another’s servant is not humiliating—quite the opposite, for it sets us free from the wearying responsibility of continuously catering to our own twisted, insatiable natures.
</li><li>It makes him feel a little lonely to realize how easy it is to be liked by someone who has no idea who he is.
</li><li>Infatuations aren’t delusions. That way they have of holding their head may truly indicate someone confident, wry, and sensitive; they really may have the humor and intelligence implied by their eyes and the tenderness suggested by their mouth. The error of the infatuation is more subtle: a failure to keep in mind the central truth of human nature: that everyone—not merely our current partners, in whose multiple failings we are such experts—but everyone will have something substantially and maddeningly wrong with them when we spend more time around them, something so wrong as to make a mockery of those initially rapturous feelings. The only people who can still strike us as normal are those we don’t yet know very well. The best cure for love is to get to know them better.

</li><li>Labels can serve goals, but goals should never serve labels. When a goal serves a label, you’ve made the label your ultimate reality, and you’ve created a life to prove or support that label. You see this when someone says, “I’m pursuing this because I’m an extrovert.” This form of goal-setting occurs when you base your goals on your current persona rather than setting goals that expand upon and change who you are.
</li><li>“The more labels you have for yourself, the dumber they make you.”
</li><li>We reinterpret or reconstruct our memory in light of what our mental set is in the present. In this sense, it is more accurate to say the present causes the meaning of the past, than it is to say that the past causes the meaning of the present [italics mine]. . . . Our memories are not “stored” and “objective” entities but living parts of ourselves in the present. This is the reason our present moods and future goals so affect our memories.
</li><li>A fundamental problem with traditional views of a fixed and innate personality is that people feel entitled to do only the things that feel natural or easy to them.
</li><li>Every behavior has a reason. Realizing why you’re engaging in a specific behavior is fundamental to becoming a conscious human being.
</li><li>Your desires shouldn’t be mistaken as the “real” you. They are simply things you’ve attached meaning to, which you can also detach from or change the meaning of.
</li><li>As trauma expert Gabor Maté, MD, says, “What we call the personality is often a jumble of genuine traits and adopted coping styles that do not reflect our true self at all but the loss of it.”
</li><li>“When you meet someone, treat them as if they were in serious trouble and you will be right more than half the time.”
</li><li>According to Dan Sullivan, the founder of Strategic Coach, when your “status” becomes more important than your “growth,” you usually stop growing. However, when growth is your genuine motive, then you usually end up getting lots of status. But you won’t be attached to it. And you’ll definitely be willing to destroy a former status to create a new one. As Sullivan says, “Always make your future bigger than your past.”
</li><li>“I firmly believe you should never spend any of your time being the ‘former’ anything.”
</li><li>“The way you see [a child] is the way you treat them and the way you treat them is [who] they [will] become.”
</li><li>“People are predictable, that’s true. . . . But they’re predictable because we see them in situations where their behavior is constrained by that situation and the roles they’re occupying and the relationships they have with us.”

</li><li>‘If life and existence were an enjoyable state, then everyone would reluctantly approach the unconscious state of sleep and would gladly rise from it again. But the very opposite is the case, for everyone very willingly goes to sleep and unwillingly gets up again.’
</li><li>The pursuit of personal happiness and the production of healthy children are two radically contrasting projects, which love maliciously confuses us into thinking of as one for a requisite number of years.
</li><li>There is only one inborn error, and that is the notion that we exist in order to be happy … So long as we persist in this inborn error … the world seems to us full of contradictions. For at every step, in great things and small, we are bound to experience that the world and life are certainly not arranged for the purpose of maintaining a happy existence … hence the countenances of almost all elderly persons wear the expression of what is called disappointment.
</li><li>Philosophy, as I have hitherto understood and lived it, is a voluntary living in ice and high mountains.
</li><li>The secret for harvesting from existence the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment is – to live dangerously! Build your cities on the slopes of Vesuvius!

The means which worked immediately, anaesthetizing and intoxicating, the so-called consolations, were ignorantly supposed to be actual cures. The fact was not noticed … that these instantaneous alleviations often had to be paid for with a general and profound worsening of the complaint.

You see less education among women, less hedonism and individualism. And to a large degree, this belief in transcendence can be passed on genetically.
</li><li>We feel nostalgia for a place simply because we’ve lived there, whether we lived well or badly scarcely matters. The past is always beautiful. So, for that matter, is the future.

Any of those things can keep you from feeling pain for a while—that’s what drugs do. And, used like a drug, over time, shopping or TV or work or whatever will make you less and less able to connect to the things that matter, like your own heart and the people you love.

</li><li>I hope you live a life you’re proud of. If you find that you are not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again. —F. Scott Fitzgerald
</li><li>I’ve realized one thing that makes it hard for me to disappoint people is my tendency to overestimate how close I am to someone, and then how imperative it is that I don’t disappoint this dear, dear friend. But upon closer inspection, I am probably not this person’s dear friend. This is probably not a deep heart wound, but probably more a small professional disappointment. Those are very different. And there’s a difference between forsaking a friendship or family relationship and speaking the truth about our limitations. I’m finding that many of our friendships actually grow when we’re more honest about what we can and can’t do.
</li><li>Part of the magic of the lake is that it isn’t home—it’s away, and away allows us to see the rhythms and dimensions of our lives more clearly.
</li><li>But what I’ve learned the hard way is you don’t answer to a wide swath of people and their opinions, even if they’re good people, with good opinions. You were made by hand with great love by the God of the universe, and he planted deep inside of you a set of loves and dreams and idiosyncrasies, and you can ignore them as long as you want, but they will at some point start yelling. Worse than that, if you ignore them long enough, they will go silent, and that’s the real tragedy.

</li><li>With mortality in the balance, one of life’s most delicious activities when you’re young—imagining your future—had become a frightening, despair-inducing exercise.
</li><li>I understood now why so many writers and artists, while in the thick of illness, became memoirists. It provided a sense of control, a way to reshape your circumstances on your own terms, in your own words. “That is what literature offers—a language powerful enough to say how it is,” Jeanette Winterson wrote. “It isn’t a hiding place. It is a finding place.”
</li><li>My doctors told me and my parents that I had about a 35 percent chance of long-term survival. Thirty-five percent. When I heard it, the number whooshed and rattled through my bones. And even if I did survive “long term,” the possible side effects, which ironically included a high risk of new cancers in the future, were also terrifying. I felt as though I was walking around with a loaded gun pressed against my temple. A medical game of Russian roulette.
</li><li>We are all terminal patients on this earth—the mystery is not “if” but “when” death appears in the plotline.
</li><li>I didn’t want their charity or their pity. I didn’t want to be anyone’s good deed of the week.
</li><li>We were learning that sometimes the only way to endure suffering is to transform it into art.
</li><li>It was the last good night we’d have together, but we didn’t know it. One rarely does.
</li><li>Grief is a ghost that visits without warning. It comes in the night and rips you from your sleep. It fills your chest with shards of glass. It interrupts you mid-laugh when you’re at a party, chastising you that, just for a moment, you’ve forgotten. It haunts you until it becomes a part of you, shadowing you breath for breath.
</li><li>ODD THINGS HAPPEN when you’re on a road trip alone. The monotony of driving becomes meditative: The mind unwrinkles. As the usual anxieties and concerns vacate, daydreams flit in. Occasionally, a wisp of an idea appears out of nowhere only to recede, a shimmery mirage in a desert. Other times, an avalanche of memories tumbles forth, loosened by an old song on the radio or a déjà vu–inducing landscape. The interplay between geography and memory becomes a conversation. They spark and spur each other.
</li><li>That night, I begin to think about how porous the border is between the sick and the well. It’s not just people like Bret and me who exist in the wilderness of survivorship. As we live longer and longer, the vast majority of us will travel back and forth across these realms, spending much of our lives somewhere in between. These are the terms of our existence. The idea of striving for some beautiful, perfect state of wellness? It mires us in eternal dissatisfaction, a goal forever out of reach. To be well now is to learn to accept whatever body and mind I currently have.
</li><li>He has a theory: When we travel, we actually take three trips. There’s the first trip of preparation and anticipation, packing and daydreaming. There’s the trip you’re actually on. And then, there’s the trip you remember. “The key is to try to keep all three as separate as possible,” he says. “The key is to be present wherever you are right now.”
</li><li>I used to think healing meant ridding the body and the heart of anything that hurt. It meant putting your pain behind you, leaving it in the past. But I’m learning that’s not how it works. Healing is figuring out how to coexist with the pain that will always live inside of you, without pretending it isn’t there or allowing it to hijack your day. It is learning to confront ghosts and to carry what lingers. It is learning to embrace the people I love now instead of protecting against a future in which I am gutted by their loss.
</li><li>But for as long as I’ve known him, Jon has been teaching me that sometimes all you can do is show up. And when things are hard, to keep on showing up.
</li><li>I’ve been traveling alone for nearly three months, sleeping in campgrounds and truck stop parking lots, staying at the homes of Internet acquaintances, and crashing with strangers I have met along the way. At every turn, the world has opened its arms to me and treated me with nothing but kindness. The road trip has rekindled a sense of strength and independence I thought I’d never recover, and it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that it’s reaffirmed my trust in humanity. In the last weeks, I’ve felt clearer, braver, more open to the unknown than I’ve ever felt in my life.
</li><li>If I’m thinking about my illness—abstracted from its impact on the people around me—then the answer is: No, I would not reverse my diagnosis if I could. I would not take back what I suffered to gain this.

</li><li>And anyway, if I wasn’t leaving I’d never have crossed paths with Nic in the first place, so it must have always been meant to happen like this. I had to be selling my stuff for him to buy it; he had to be arriving for me to be able to say goodbye.

</li><li>The thing about life after formal education is that nobody gives you an appraisal on how you do life – after school there’s no marks out of ten or grades on a scale of A to Ungraded that let you know you’re doing it right. And I’ve been so pent up and stressed, what I’ve needed is somebody to say: Hey, this is a shock, and not ideal, but you’re doing it well anyway.
</li><li>But actually, holding ourselves back from commitment is the true constriction. When we fully invest ourselves in something, we are free to bloom, unrestricted, and so there’s a beautiful sovereignty to it when we decide to go all in.’
</li><li>If I could bottle this feeling, I could make a fortune.
</li><li>I’m laughing at nothing, happy just to be here, against all the odds, making strangers into friends and my own body, my own soul and mind and heart my home. I live here, I think to myself. Not in a place, but within myself. And that’s exactly what I’ve been chasing, this feeling. Peace.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Tuesday, November 1, 2022 8:22:30 PM
</h4><ul><li>I think there are a lot of us out there. People who didn’t have THE WORST CHILDHOODS EVER, people who had it “pretty good” but nevertheless find themselves regularly crying in their cubicles at work. We’ve achieved the outward markers of a happy, lucky life, but underneath it all, we’re terrible at truly living. We walk around with overwhelming anxiety and emotional pain, and then we feel guilt and shame because “I didn’t have it that bad—I should be fine!” My answer to you is No. You do not have to be fine. If you went through some shit, even if it was “minor,” and it’s affecting your life, then you deserve to deal with that shit. Period.
</li><li>When we finally had our official time to sit with Jon, another intern asked him what his first “big break” was. Jon very quickly, very firmly responded: “There are no big breaks. There are only a series of tiny, little breaks. The key is to work
</li><li>Today, I tell young people who ask for professional advice to be the best at the worst. Take whatever weird little opportunity you have and maximize the fuck out of it. In a best-case scenario, someone cool will notice. In a worst-case scenario, you will notice and feel pride knowing you are doing a good job, even if the task sucks. Simply put: Start where you are without worrying too much about how far you have to go.
</li><li>My journal was a safe place where I could be vulnerable and write about how my world felt: violent, tumultuous, confusing, and dangerous.
</li><li>That which you do not deal with deals with you. Always.
</li><li>You can’t control the narrative of the outside world, but you can control the story you are telling yourself in your journal.
</li><li>In the most soothing, wise, and loving voice, the brilliant Tara Brach teaches self-compassion through guided meditations. In “The R-A-I-N of Self-Compassion” you Recognize, Allow, Investigate, and Nurture any challenging feelings. This is an incredible (easy to remember) tool for self-care and I highly recommend that you subscribe to her podcast. Her voice makes you feel like you just put on your favorite comfy sweater. Nothing bad can happen to you while you listen to Tara Brach.
</li><li>Chances are, if you are justifying something you are doing as a means to “deal” with your day, then it’s probably not a great idea.
</li><li>Dr. Goldstein suggested wearing rubber bands on my wrists so that when the obsessive thoughts looped in my head, I could snap the bands against my skin and say, “Let go. Let go.” Somehow, the pain would change the neural pathways in my brain and help reprogram my thinking. Instead of thinking, I am abandoned, my brain would say, Ouch! That thought doesn’t pay off. As weird a solution as that sounded, it did help.
</li><li>Running blasted through that anxiety knot in my chest. The more I moved, the more I was able to shake loose the mean little bullet of worry that had lodged itself in my heart. There was something cathartic about the motion of pushing myself forward. The movement itself broke up the harsh thought loops in my head.
</li><li>When I feel hopeless or depressed or like an anxiety ball of bad vibes, I write a thank-you card to someone, anyone.
</li><li>No one has ever complained about getting too many thank-you notes from someone if the sentiment is authentic. I now keep blank cards with me wherever I go, much like one might keep emergency Xanax. You never know when you are going to need the sweet relief of gratitude.
</li><li>Buy the fucking lilies. You are worth seven-dollar lilies. You are worth the thing that instantly makes your life better.
</li><li>We ALL feel weird about money. The best way to feel un-weird about it is to become aware of the role it is playing in your life and to forgive, forgive, forgive yourself for any shame, any fuckups, any times you have stumbled.
</li><li>“Busy” is worn as a badge of honor these days; the busier we are, the more important we feel. But busy doesn’t mean important. Busy just means you are preoccupied. And often it means you’re distracted. It doesn’t mean you are esteemed, fun, smart, worthy, valued, loved, appreciated, excited, or happy. Busy likely means you are not paying attention to the current moment but instead are hustling around in a fog of things you “have” to do. Busy isn’t special. We are all busy. So why label yourself something so common? You’re better than that.
</li><li>“The thing about moving,” he said, “is it’s a good way to shake loose whatever old baggage you have, or the old things that were true about yourself, and decide what you want to be true about yourself. It’s the best way to make new habits that serve you.”
</li><li>In the morning, write down something nice that you will do for yourself and then think about it all day. Make time at the end of your day to do it. It’s lovely to spend the whole day looking forward to the nice thing you are going to give yourself. You can’t control how the outside world treats you, but you can and must decide how you treat yourself. When you do one nice thing for yourself, every single day, then you are guaranteed to treasure at least one part of your day.
</li><li>The creators of Warby Parker, the founders of Google, director Ava DuVernay, Stephen King, T. S. Eliot—they all kept their day jobs even as they were pursuing their passions. “Having a sense of security in one realm gives us the freedom to be original in another,” Adam so wisely wrote.
</li><li>You can’t fix a car that’s on fire as it careens down the highway. You have to pull to the shoulder of the road, smother the flames, wait for the smoke to settle, and then you can assess the problem and fix the car. Clonazepam was a very important fire extinguisher for me.
</li><li>“The only thing that matters in the long run is the bonds you create. You won’t be on your deathbed wishing you’d worked more or achieved something greater professionally. You’ll be looking back on your friendships, your kinships; you’ll be thinking about the people you love and who loved you. Your bonds are what give your life meaning. Your relationships give you strength.”
</li><li>Listen to me very, very carefully: You don’t have to make plans with people you don’t want to make plans with. I stopped hanging out with people whom I only saw out of a sense of obligation, and NOTHING bad has happened to me.
</li><li>It turns out you can’t command the perceptions of others, and the more you try, the more you risk losing your own sense of self-worth and alienating people. It took decades of running myself ragged trying to gain acceptance from others for me to learn a fundamental truth I would now like to share with you: No one cares. No one is watching you. No one is tallying the total of your decisions, judging you from afar. They are not doing this because they are too worried about themselves. They are making all kinds of judgments about their own lives and worries, and I love you very much, but they are just not thinking about you right now.
</li><li>If you are, right now, unable to believe that you are worth more, if you are currently settling or considering settling, then let me also tell you this: Settling doesn’t work. All of those feelings of loneliness that you are trying to solve with the person who is “fine” will follow you into your relationship and you will feel alone together. And there is just about nothing worse than feeling lonely in the intimate company of someone else. It’s a certain kind of despair to feel like paper dolls, rigidly moving about, playing house, acting as if you are in love, but in reality, you’re just thin, fake replicas of the real deal. The real deal is out there for you. I don’t know when you will find it. I can’t offer a prediction for the future, but I can tell you, unequivocally, that the more time you spend with people you know are not right, the more you put off finding love. You simply can’t draw the right person into your orbit if you are busy with the wrong one. For my part, I am trying to attract the sun. Someone who is secure, optimistic, and loving. Someone I am not afraid to be intimate with. Someone who is my true partner and, in the long run, a supportive friend. I want a guy I feel “fuck yeah” about, or I don’t want to be with anyone at all. I want to tap-dance and sing from the top of the Hollywood sign about how much I admire him and how I feel so fucking superb in his company—otherwise, I would rather hang out with my Lady Harem. ACTUALLY, I want someone I am thrilled to introduce to my Lady Harem so we can all hang out together. I want this person to bring something bright into my life, and I want to do the same for him. I want to get out of my own damn way. I’m ready. If you know of such a person, would you mind an intro? After all, if you don’t set me up, who will? A List of Questions to Ask Yourself When You Start Dating Someone That I PRAY TO FUCKING GOD Will Help You Break Your Old Patterns and Find Something Better, EVEN IF You Are Really, Really Ready for This “Whole Dating Thing” to Be Over Is there a connection? Is there a spark? Is there an attraction? An “OH YES! I FEEL THIS!”? Or. Did he put his hand on your shoulder and your skin crawled? When he kissed you did it feel like his tongue was jamming itself down your throat as if to suffocate you? Is there something—it does not need to be physical—in this person that draws you to them? It’s not mean to answer “no” to this question. But it is a waste of time to go any further. Is this person kind and thoughtful? It’s easy to tell: Did your date ask questions about you?
</li><li>If you are, right now, unable to believe that you are worth more, if you are currently settling or considering settling, then let me also tell you this: Settling doesn’t work. All of those feelings of loneliness that you are trying to solve with the person who is “fine” will follow you into your relationship and you will feel alone together. And there is just about nothing worse than feeling lonely in the intimate company of someone else.
</li><li>You taught me that when someone tells you what’s not possible for you, they are projecting their own limiting beliefs about themselves.
</li><li>Maya Angelou once wisely pointed out that “when someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.”
</li><li>My advice to you is to be very careful about how you talk about yourself, because, very often, the people around you are listening.
</li><li>We go through life thinking that other people’s behavior toward us is DEEPLY PERSONAL. If the people close to us are acting in a hurtful way, we reason that it is very specifically about us. We then tend to internalize it and question ourselves. What did I do wrong to deserve this? We blame ourselves: They wouldn’t have treated us in this fundamentally shitty way if we were worthy of better. But I’m here to tell you directly: This is madness. The way a person treats you has almost nothing to do with you. It’s about them and their limitations. They are dealing with their own shit, and mostly that shit is so buried within them that they don’t even know what’s going on!
</li><li>That is where you have all the power in the world. Try letting go of the notion that anyone is mistreating you on purpose, and stand back as you watch resentment and anger float away. It takes time, it takes practice, but it does work. As you clear away all of those feelings that were holding you down, that were telling you, “This horrible thing is being done TO ME,” watch as you find more room in yourself for love and compassion.
</li><li>Would you blame yourself for bad weather? Would you blame yourself for a fire that ravaged your house? Then don’t blame yourself for how other people treat you, because you have zero control over that. Instead, the thing you have control over is how you react.
</li><li>I think that a lot of people lead their lives never having really lived them at all. They play the roles they were assigned early in life, without questioning if they even want to be this way. They get comfortable, even with really uncomfortable circumstances. They let the days and weeks and years wash over them and never see that they have the power to change IT ALL.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Sunday, November 6, 2022 1:40:42 PM
</h4><ul><li>The twentieth-century Indian meditation master Sri Nisargadatta encourages us to wholeheartedly enter this path of freedom: “. . . all I plead with you is this: make love of your self perfect.”
</li><li>“I’m skimming over life and racing to the finish line—death.”
</li><li>all suffering or dissatisfaction arises from a mistaken understanding that we are a separate and distinct self.
</li><li>What we experience as the “self” is an aggregate of familiar thoughts, emotions and patterns of behavior. The mind binds these together, creating a story about a personal, individual entity that has continuity through time. Everything we experience is subsumed into this story of self and becomes my experience.
</li><li>When we take life personally by I-ing and my-ing, the universal sense that “something is wrong” easily solidifies into “something is wrong with me.”
</li><li>Even if we were to win millions of dollars in the lottery or marry the perfect person, as long as we feel not good enough, we won’t be able to enjoy the possibilities before us.
</li><li>The poet Rumi saw clearly the relationship between our wounds and our awakening. He counseled, “Don’t turn away. Keep your gaze on the bandaged place. That’s where the light enters you.” When we look directly at the bandaged place without denying or avoiding it, we become tender toward our human vulnerability. Our attention allows the light of wisdom and compassion to enter.
</li><li>The boundary to what we can accept is the boundary to our freedom.
</li><li>Many times since then, especially when I’ve been caught up in tension or self-judgment, I have stopped and asked myself, “What would it be like if I could accept life—accept this moment—exactly as it is?” Regardless of which particular mental movie has been playing, just the intention to accept my experience begins to deepen my attention and soften my heart.
</li><li>As author Storm Jameson puts it: There is only one world, the world pressing against you at this minute. There is only one minute in which you are alive, this minute here and now. The only way to live is by accepting each minute as an unrepeatable miracle.
</li><li>Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are only princesses waiting for us to act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love.”
</li><li>But as Ed points out, when we stop comparing ourselves to some assumed standard of perfection, the “biscuits of today,” this very life we are living right now, can be tasted and explored, honored and appreciated fully. When we put down ideas of what life should be like, we are free to wholeheartedly say yes to our life as it is.
</li><li>Sincerely explore for yourself, are you here or not? Are you in your body or oblivious, or only aware of parts of it? When I say, “Are you in your body?” I mean, “Are you completely filling your body?” I want to know whether you are in your feet, or just have feet. Do you live in them, or are they just things you use when you walk? Are you in your belly, or do you just know vaguely that you have a belly? Or is it just for food? Are you really in your hands, or do you move them from a distance? Are you present in your cells, inhabiting and filling your body? If you aren’t in your body, what significance is there in your experience this moment? Are you preparing, so that you can be here in the future? Are you setting up conditions by saying to yourself, “When such and such happens I’ll have time, I’ll be here.” If you are not here, what are you saving yourself for?
</li><li>All our reactions to people, to situations, to thoughts in our mind—are actually reactions to the kind of sensations that are arising in our body.
</li><li>We become, as Chogyam Trungpa puts it, “a bundle of tense muscles defending our existence.”
</li><li>When we are in the trance of fear, the rest of the world fades into the background. Like the lens on a camera, our attention narrows to focus exclusively on the foreground of our fearful stories and our efforts to feel more secure.
</li><li>Being genuinely awake in the midst of fear requires the willingness to actively contact the sensations of fear.
</li><li>When we feel held by a caring presence, by something larger than our small frightened self, we begin to find room in our own heart for the fragments of our life, and for the lives of others. The suffering that might have seemed “too much” can awaken us to the sweetness of compassion.
</li><li>We feel most “who we are” when we feel connected to each other and the world around us, when our hearts are open, generous and filled with love.
</li><li>The poet Longfellow writes, “If we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each man’s life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility.”
</li><li>If we ask ourselves when meeting anyone—friend or stranger—“How can I be more kind?” inevitably we will recognize that every being needs to be listened to, loved and understood.
</li><li>Novelist and mystic Romaine Rolland says, “There is only one heroism in the world: to see the world as it is, and to love it.”
</li><li>What we know of other people Is only our memory of the moments During which we knew them. And they have Changed since then . . . We must Also remember That at every meeting we are meeting a Stranger.
</li><li>In the words of physician and author Rachel Naomi Remen, “One moment of unconditional love may call into question a lifetime of feeling unworthy and invalidate it.”
</li><li>When we expose our own hurt or fear, we actually give others permission to be more authentic.
</li><li>Realizing the truth of belonging, that we are all suffering and awakening together on the path, is the most powerful antidote to personal feelings of unworthiness.
</li><li>O longing mind, Dwell within the depth Of your own pure nature. Do not seek your home elsewhere . . . Your naked awareness alone, O mind, Is the inexhaustible abundance For which you long so desperately.
</li><li>Sometimes the protective bubble of my car can be as good a space for touching the moment as the most sacred of meditation halls.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Friday, January 20, 2023 11:15:31 AM
</h4><ul><li>My favorite Wikipedia entry begins: “Ronald James Read was an American philanthropist, investor, janitor, and gas station attendant.”
</li><li>Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what’s happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works. So equally smart people can disagree about how and why recessions happen, how you should invest your money, what you should prioritize, how much risk you should take, and so on.
</li><li>The lowest-income households in the U.S. on average spend $412 a year on lotto tickets, four times the amount of those in the highest income groups. Forty percent of Americans cannot come up with $400 in an emergency. Which is to say: Those buying $400 in lottery tickets are by and large the same people who say they couldn’t come up with $400 in an emergency. They are blowing their safety nets on something with a one-in-millions chance of hitting it big.
</li><li>Before World War II most Americans worked until they died. That was the expectation and the reality. The labor force participation rate of men age 65 and over was above 50% until the 1940s:
</li><li>The share of Americans over age 25 with a bachelor’s degree has gone from less than 1 in 20 in 1940 to 1 in 4 by 2015.⁷
</li><li>You are one person in a game with seven billion other people and infinite moving parts. The accidental impact of actions outside of your control can be more consequential than the ones you consciously take.
</li><li>For every Bill Gates there is a Kent Evans who was just as skilled and driven but ended up on the other side of life roulette.
</li><li>Be careful who you praise and admire. Be careful who you look down upon and wish to avoid becoming.
</li><li>The more extreme the outcome, the less likely you can apply its lessons to your own life, because the more likely the outcome was influenced by extreme ends of luck or risk.
</li><li>My favorite historian, Frederick Lewis Allen, spent his career depicting the life of the average, median American—how they lived, how they changed, what they did for work, what they ate for dinner, etc. There are more relevant lessons to take away from this kind of broad observation than there are in studying the extreme characters that tend to dominate the news.
</li><li>There are a million ways to get wealthy, and plenty of books on how to do so. But there’s only one way to stay wealthy: some combination of frugality and paranoia.
</li><li>Compounding doesn’t rely on earning big returns. Merely good returns sustained uninterrupted for the longest period of time—especially in times of chaos and havoc—will always win.
</li><li>When we pay special attention to a role model’s successes we overlook that their gains came from a small percent of their actions. That makes our own failures, losses, and setbacks feel like we’re doing something wrong. But it’s possible we are wrong, or just sort of right, just as often as the masters are.
</li><li>“It’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important,” George Soros once said, “but how much money you make when you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong.”
</li><li>The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, “I can do whatever I want today.”
</li><li>The letter I wrote after my son was born said, “You might think you want an expensive car, a fancy watch, and a huge house. But I’m telling you, you don’t. What you want is respect and admiration from other people, and you think having expensive stuff will bring it. It almost never does—especially from the people you want to respect and admire you.”
</li><li>When you define savings as the gap between your ego and your income you realize why many people with decent incomes save so little. It’s a daily struggle against instincts to extend your peacock feathers to their outermost limits and keep up with others doing the same.
</li><li>A trap many investors fall into is what I call “historians as prophets” fallacy: An overreliance on past data as a signal to future conditions in a field where innovation and change are the lifeblood of progress.
</li><li>The majority of what’s happening at any given moment in the global economy can be tied back to a handful of past events that were nearly impossible to predict.
</li><li>“the purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary.”
</li><li>Sunk costs—anchoring decisions to past efforts that can’t be refunded—are a devil in a world where people change over time. They make our future selves prisoners to our past, different, selves. It’s the equivalent of a stranger making major life decisions for you.
</li><li>Pessimism just sounds smarter and more plausible than optimism. Tell someone that everything will be great and they’re likely to either shrug you off or offer a skeptical eye. Tell someone they’re in danger and you have their undivided attention.
</li><li>Hindsight, the ability to explain the past, gives us the illusion that the world is understandable. It gives us the illusion that the world makes sense, even when it doesn’t make sense. That’s a big deal in producing mistakes in many fields.
</li><li>Less ego, more wealth. Saving money is the gap between your ego and your income, and wealth is what you don’t see. So wealth is created by suppressing what you could buy today in order to have more stuff or more options in the future. No matter how much you earn, you will never build wealth unless you can put a lid on how much fun you can have with your money right now, today.
</li><li>But the foundation of, “does this help me sleep at night?” is the best universal guidepost for all financial decisions.
</li><li>You should like risk because it pays off over time. But you should be paranoid of ruinous risk because it prevents you from taking future risks that will pay off over time.
</li><li>Good decisions aren’t always rational. At some point you have to choose between being happy or being “right.”
</li><li>My investing strategy doesn’t rely on picking the right sector, or timing the next recession. It relies on a high savings rate, patience, and optimism that the global economy will create value over the next several decades. I spend virtually all of my investing effort thinking about those three things—especially the first two, which I can control.
</li><li>Between 1993 and 2012, the top 1 percent saw their incomes grow 86.1 percent, while the bottom 99 percent saw just 6.6 percent growth.

</li><li>Happiness is a by-product. It is achieved indirectly, by producing something beautiful or useful or by making someone else happy. The search for happiness is one of the chief sources of unhappiness.

Copernicus fostered the vision of a multiplicity of worlds and a wider universe, and he revealed it; Buddha beheld the vision of a spiritual world of stainless beauty and perfect peace, and he entered it. Cherish your visions; cherish your ideals; cherish the music that stirs in your heart, the beauty that forms in your mind, the loveliness that drapes your purest thoughts, for out of them will grow all delightful conditions, all heavenly environment; of these, if you but remain true to them, your world will at last be built.

Do not believe anything because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe anything because it is written down in religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and the benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it.”

</li><li>Paradoxically, the shortest route to financial freedom is to fight the acquisitive instinct and the desire to appear wealthy.
</li><li>Whenever we act, we are never just doing. We are always becoming. If we aren’t growing, we are diminishing.
</li><li>In the 1930s, for example, world trade had contracted by two thirds. Businesses failed in record numbers. One in four workers was unemployed. People lost their homes, their savings, and their dignity, and depended on charity to survive. Stock prices plunged 89 percent from peak to trough. Skilled workers and former business executives walked the streets selling apples or shining shoes to earn money for bread.
</li><li>The future is always fraught with uncertainty. But history gives us a sense of proportion. It tells us who we are and where we’ve been. It enlarges our view. And while we sometimes fall short of our ideals, it reminds us how they have guided us in the past . . . and should still lead us today. Without history, we lose our story—and our bearings. We forget who we are and what it has taken to come this far. A sense of history is a strong antidote to self-pity or self-importance. It inspires courage and humility. History reinforces what we believe in, what we’re willing to stand up for.

Around the world, a billion people struggle to live each day on less than you paid for that drink. You can help them.
</li><li>Imagine that the 13.7-billion-year history of the universe is compressed into one calendar year. The Big Bang occurred in the very first second of January 1, and the current moment is the last second of the last minute of December 31. Using this compressed time scale, each month equals a little over 1.1 billion years. Each day represents 40 million years. Each second covers 500 years of history. The Milky Way coalesces in March. The sun and planets form in August. The first life—single celled—shows up in September, the first multicellular organisms in November. The first vertebrates appear on December 17. Dinosaurs show up on Christmas Eve (and become extinct on December 29). Modern humans finally appear at 11:54 pm on December 31. And all of recorded history occupies the last 10 seconds of the last minute of the last day of the year. The pyramids were built nine seconds ago. The Roman Empire fell three seconds ago. Columbus discovered America one second ago.
</li><li>The Big Bang model has lasted more than 70 years, and the evidence keeps mounting. (For an excellent overview, I recommend Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe [Harper Perennial, 2005] by particle physicist Simon Singh, a highly readable book on the subject.)
</li><li>After sleeping through a hundred million centuries we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet, sparkling with color, bountiful with life. Within decades we must close our eyes again. Isn’t it a noble, an enlightened way of spending our brief time in the sun, to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it? . . .

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Saturday, January 28, 2023 2:11:39 PM
</h4><ul><li>Nobody knows how long ago human beings developed language, but most estimates range from around 2 million years ago, when hominid brains became much bigger, to as recently as 40,000 years ago, the time of cave paintings and other artifacts that reveal unmistakably modern human minds.
</li><li>An emotionally intelligent person has a skilled rider who knows how to distract and coax the elephant without having to engage in a direct contest of wills.
</li><li>It’s hard for the controlled system to beat the automatic system by willpower alone; like a tired muscle,30 the former soon wears down and caves in, but the latter runs automatically, effortlessly, and endlessly. Once you understand the power of stimulus control, you can use it to your advantage by changing the stimuli in your environment and avoiding undesirable ones; or, if that’s not possible, by filling your consciousness with thoughts about their less tempting aspects.
</li><li>In fact, happiness is one of the most highly heritable aspects of personality. Twin studies generally show that from 50 percent to 80 percent of all the variance among people in their average levels of happiness can be explained by differences in their genes rather than in their life experiences.
</li><li>For Buddha, attachments are like a game of roulette in which someone else spins the wheel and the game is rigged: The more you play, the more you lose. The only way to win is to step away from the table. And the only way to step away, to make yourself not react to the ups and downs of life, is to meditate and tame the mind. Although you give up the pleasures of winning, you also give up the larger pains of losing.
</li><li>Robin Dunbar19 has demonstrated that within a given group of vertebrate species—primates, carnivores, ungulates, birds, reptiles, or fish—the logarithm of the brain size is almost perfectly proportional to the logarithm of the social group size.

</li><li>Feeling Good,36 a popular guide to cognitive therapy, David Burns
</li><li>When we combine the adaptation principle with the discovery that people’s average level of happiness is highly heritable,11 we come to a startling possibility: In the long run, it doesn’t much matter what happens to you. Good fortune or bad, you will always return to your happiness setpoint—your brain’s default level of happiness—which was determined largely by your genes.
</li><li>One of the most adventurous young psychologists, Robert Biswas-Diener (son of the happiness pioneer Ed Diener), has done just that. He has traveled the world interviewing people about their lives and how satisfied they are with them. Wherever he goes, from Greenland to Kenya to California, he finds that most people (with the exception of homeless people) are more satisfied than dissatisfied with their lives.

</li><li>Humans are the only creatures on Earth whose young are utterly helpless for years, and heavily dependent on adult care for more than a decade.
</li><li>Aristophanes’ toast to love is a myth about its origins. Aristophanes says that people originally had four legs, four arms, and two faces, but one day the gods felt threatened by the power and arrogance of human beings and decided to cut them in half. Ever since that day, people have wandered the world searching for their other halves.
</li><li>Nobody can think straight when high on passionate love. The rider is as besotted as the elephant. People are not allowed to sign contracts when they are drunk, and I sometimes wish we could prevent people from proposing marriage when they are high on passionate love because once a marriage proposal is accepted, families are notified, and a date is set, it’s very hard to stop the train. The drug is likely to wear off at some point during the stressful wed-ding planning phase, and many of these couples will walk down the aisle with doubt in their hearts and divorce in their future.
</li><li>His findings can be summarized in one word: constraints. No matter how he parsed the data, people who had fewer social constraints, bonds, and obligations were more likely to kill themselves.
</li><li>And you can learn to become a sense maker by reading Jamie Pennebaker’s Opening Up.30
</li><li>We do not receive wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness which no one else can make for us, which no one can spare us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world.
</li><li>The strong version of the adversity hypothesis might be true, but only if we add caveats: For adversity to be maximally beneficial, it should happen at the right time (young adulthood), to the right people (those with the social and psychological resources to rise to challenges and find benefits), and to the right degree (not so severe as to cause PTSD).
</li><li>One of the best predictors of the health of an American neighborhood is the degree to which adults respond to the misdeeds of other people’s children.33 When community standards are enforced, there is constraint and cooperation. When everyone minds his own business and looks the other way, there is freedom and anomie.
</li><li>Disgust extinguishes desire (hunger) and motivates purifying behaviors such as washing or, if it’s too late, vomiting.
</li><li>Oxytocin causes bonding, not action. Elevation may fill people with feelings of love, trust,30 and openness, making them more receptive to new relationships; yet, given their feelings of relaxation and passivity, they might be less likely to engage in active altruism toward strangers.
</li><li>Ralph Waldo Emerson, a founder of the movement, wrote: Standing on the bare ground—my head bathed by the blithe air and uplifted into infinite space—all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eyeball; I am nothing; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or parcel of God. The name of the nearest friend sounds then foreign and accidental; to be brothers, to be acquaintances, master or servant, is then a trifle and a disturbance. I am the lover of uncontained and immortal beauty.
</li><li>In a small gem of a book, Religions, Values, and Peak Experiences,44 Maslow listed twenty-five common features of peak experiences, nearly all of which can be found somewhere in William James. Here are some: The universe is perceived as a unified whole where everything is accepted and nothing is judged or ranked; egocentrism and goal-striving disappear as a person feels merged with the universe (and often with God); perceptions of time and space are altered; and the person is flooded with feelings of wonder, awe, joy, love, and gratitude.
</li><li>I finally escaped when, after a week of thinking about suicide (in the abstract, not as a plan), I turned the problem inside out. There is no God and no externally given meaning to life, I thought, so from one perspective it really wouldn’t matter if I killed myself tomorrow. Very well, then everything beyond tomorrow is a gift with no strings and no expectations. There is no test to hand in at the end of life, so there is no way to fail. If this really is all there is, why not embrace it, rather than throw it away?
</li><li>Leo Tolstoy wrote: “One can live magnificently in this world, if one knows how to work and how to love, to work for the person one loves and to love one’s work.”
</li><li>Psychologists have referred to this basic need as a need for competence, industry, or mastery. White called it the “effectance motive,” which he defined as the need or drive to develop competence through interacting with and controlling one’s environment. Effectance is almost as basic a need as food and water, yet it is not a deficit need, like hunger, that is satisfied and then disappears for a few hours.
</li><li>The evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson45 has recently argued that the banishment of group selection theories on the basis of some oversimplified computer models from the 1960s was one of the biggest mistakes in the history of modern biology.
</li><li>Because elements of culture show variation (people invent new things) and selection (other people do or don’t adopt those variations), cultural traits can be analyzed in a Darwinian framework46 just as well as physical traits (birds’ beaks, giraffes’ necks).
</li><li>Reading Wilson’s Darwin’s Cathedral is like taking a journey to Spaceland. You can look down on the vast tapestry of human cultures and see why things are woven in the way that they are.
</li><li>The final version of the happiness hypothesis is that happiness comes from between. Happiness is not something that you can find, acquire, or achieve directly. You have to get the conditions right and then wait. Some of those conditions are within you, such as coherence among the parts and levels of your personality. Other conditions require relationships to things beyond you: Just as plants need sun, water, and good soil to thrive, people need love, work, and a connection to something larger. It is worth striving to get the right relationships between yourself and others, between yourself and your work, and between yourself and something larger than yourself. If you get these relationships right, a sense of purpose and meaning will emerge.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Tuesday, January 31, 2023 10:04:15 PM
</h4><ul><li>According to Epicurus, for example, “Vain is the word of a philosopher which does not heal any suffering of man. For just as there is no profit in medicine if it does not expel the diseases of the body, so there is no profit in philosophy either, if it does not expel the suffering of the mind.”
</li><li>The first of these was the 1998 publication by the author Tom Wolfe of A Man in Full. In this novel, one character accidentally discovers the Stoic philosopher Epictetus and then starts spouting his philosophy.
</li><li>Epictetus explained what becoming a Cynic would entail: “You must utterly put away the will to get, and must will to avoid only what lies within the sphere of your will: you must harbour no anger, wrath, envy, pity: a fair maid, a fair name, favourites, or sweet cakes, must mean nothing to you.” A Cynic, he explained, “must have the spirit of patience in such measure as to seem to the multitude as unfeeling as a stone. Reviling or blows or insults are nothing to him.”
</li><li>For the Stoics, a person’s virtue does not depend, for example, on her sexual history. Instead, it depends on her excellence as a human being—on how well she performs the function for which humans were designed. In the same way that a “virtuous” (or excellent) hammer is one that performs well the function for which it was designed—namely, to drive nails—a virtuous individual is one who performs well the function for which humans were designed. To be virtuous, then, is to live as we were designed to live; it is to live, as Zeno put it, in accordance with nature.
</li><li>Readers need to keep in mind, though, that unlike Cynicism, Stoicism does not require its adherents to adopt an ascetic lifestyle. To the contrary, the Stoics thought there is nothing wrong with enjoying the good things life has to offer, as long as we are careful in the manner in which we enjoy them. In particular, we must be ready to give up the good things without regret if our circumstances should change.
</li><li>Misfortune weighs most heavily, he says, on those who “expect nothing but good fortune.”
</li><li>Around the world and throughout the millennia, those who have thought carefully about the workings of desire have recognized this—that the easiest way for us to gain happiness is to learn how to want the things we already have.
</li><li>Thus, Epictetus counsels that when we say good-bye to a friend, we should silently remind ourselves that this might be our final parting.
</li><li>To be able to be satisfied with little is not a failing, it is a blessing—if, at any rate, what you seek is satisfaction. And if you seek something other than satisfaction, I would inquire (with astonishment) into what it is that you find more desirable than satisfaction. What, I would ask, could possibly be worth sacrificing satisfaction in order to obtain?
</li><li>There will be—or already has been!—a last time in your life that you brush your teeth, cut your hair, drive a car, mow the lawn, or play hopscotch. There will be a last time you hear the sound of snow falling, watch the moon rise, smell popcorn, feel the warmth of a child falling asleep in your arms, or make love. You will someday eat your last meal, and soon thereafter you will take your last breath.
</li><li>A better strategy for getting what you want, he says, is to make it your goal to want only those things that are easy to obtain—and ideally to want only those things that you can be certain of obtaining.
</li><li>I think that when a Stoic concerns himself with things over which he has some but not complete control, such as winning a tennis match, he will be very careful about the goals he sets for himself. In particular, he will be careful to set internal rather than external goals. Thus, his goal in playing tennis will not be to win a match (something external, over which he has only partial control) but to play to the best of his ability in the match (something internal, over which he has complete control).
</li><li>According to Seneca, Epicurus, a philosophical rival to the Stoics, also practiced poverty.2 His goal in doing so, however, appears to have been different from that of Seneca. Whereas Seneca wanted to appreciate what he had, Epicurus wanted to examine the things he thought he needed so he could determine which of them he could in fact live without. He realized that in many cases, we work hard to obtain something because we are convinced that we would be miserable without it. The problem is that we can live perfectly well without some of these things, but we won’t know which they are if we don’t try living without them.
</li><li>Or, changing the metaphor a bit, he tells us that intense pleasures, when captured by us, become our captors, meaning that the more pleasures a man captures, “the more masters will he have to serve.”
</li><li>Seneca said it well: “To know how many are jealous of you, count your admirers.”
</li><li>Suppose that even though we follow the above advice, someone succeeds in annoying us. In such cases, Marcus says, we should remind ourselves that “this mortal life endures but a moment,” meaning that we soon will be dead.11 Putting annoying incidents into their cosmic context, he thinks, will make their triviality apparent and will therefore alleviate our annoyance.
</li><li>Refusing to respond to an insult is, paradoxically, one of the most effective responses possible. For one thing, as Seneca points out, our nonresponse can be quite disconcerting to the insulter, who will wonder whether or not we understood his insult. Furthermore, we are robbing him of the pleasure of having upset us, and he is likely to be upset as a result.
</li><li>PEOPLE ARE UNHAPPY, the Stoics argue, in large part because they are confused about what is valuable. Because of their confusion, they spend their days pursuing things that, rather than making them happy, make them anxious and miserable.
</li><li>Realize that many other people, including, quite possibly, your friends and relatives, want you to fail in your undertakings. They may not tell you this to your face, but this doesn’t mean that they aren’t silently rooting against you. People do this in part because your success makes them look bad and therefore makes them uncomfortable: If you can succeed, why can’t they? Consequently, if you attempt something daring they might ridicule you, predict disaster, and try to talk you out of pursuing your goal.
</li><li>If you have a philosophy of life, decision making is relatively straightforward: When choosing between the options life offers, you simply choose the one most likely to help you attain the goals set forth by your philosophy of life. In the absence of a philosophy of life, though, even relatively simple choices can degenerate into meaning-of-life crises. It is, after all, hard to know what to choose when you aren’t really sure what you want.
</li><li>René Descartes revealed his Stoic leanings in his Discourse on Method. At one point he describes the maxims that, if followed, would enable him to live as happily as was possible. The third of these maxims could have been—indeed, probably was—lifted straight out of Epictetus: “Always to seek to conquer myself rather than fortune, to change my desires rather than the established order, and generally to believe that nothing except our thoughts is wholly under our control, so that after we have done our best in external matters, what remains to be done is absolutely impossible, at least as far as we are concerned.”
</li><li>Many of us have been persuaded that happiness is something that someone else, a therapist or a politician, must confer on us. Stoicism rejects this notion. It teaches us that we are very much responsible for our happiness as well as our unhappiness. It also teaches us that it is only when we assume responsibility for our happiness that we will have a reasonable chance of gaining it.
</li><li>You would do well, I think, to keep it a secret that you are a practicing Stoic. (This would have been my own strategy, had I not taken it upon myself to become a teacher of Stoicism.) By practicing Stoicism stealthily, you can gain its benefits while avoiding one significant cost: the teasing and outright mockery of your friends, relatives, neighbors, and coworkers.
</li><li>Self-deprecating humor has become my standard response to insults. When someone criticizes me, I reply that matters are even worse than he is suggesting. If, for example, someone suggests that I am lazy, I reply that it is a miracle that I get any work done at all. If someone accuses me of having a big ego, I reply that on most days it is noon before I become aware that anyone else inhabits the planet.
</li><li>In particular, I have found that one wonderful way to avoid getting angry is to imagine myself as a character in an absurdist play: Things aren’t supposed to make sense, people aren’t supposed to be competent, and justice, when it happens at all, happens by accident. Instead of letting myself be angered by events, I persuade myself to laugh at them. Indeed, I try to think of ways the imaginary absurdist playwright could have made things still more absurd.
</li><li>One other discovery I have made in my practice of Stoicism concerns joy. The joy the Stoics were interested in can best be described as a kind of objectless enjoyment—an enjoyment not of any particular thing but of all this. It is a delight in simply being able to participate in life. It is a profound realization that even though all this didn’t have to be possible, it is possible—wonderfully, magnificently possible.
</li><li>Readers might also want to take a look at Arthur Schopenhauer’s essays in The Wisdom of Life and Counsels and Maxims.

</li><li>According to paleoanthropologists, our species, Homo sapiens, arose about 200,000 years ago7 in and around the Rift Valley, which runs through what is now Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. It was only 60,000 to 70,000 years ago that they left Africa.
</li><li>In fact, research suggests that as recently as 8,000 years ago, your ancestors were dark-skinned.12 The scientific consensus is that light-skinned people evolved only when members of our species moved to higher latitudes in Europe.
</li><li>Yes, marriage between first cousins doubles the chance that their offspring will have birth defects—but the doubling is from 2 percent to only 4 percent.
</li><li>And whereas a slender (by current standards) human male might be 20 percent fat by body weight, a male chimpanzee might be only 0.005 percent!
</li><li>The combination of speed and accuracy means that we humans have what is by a large margin the best throwing arm in the animal world. Even if you are old and arthritic, there is a good chance that you can outthrow a chimpanzee.
</li><li>Whereas modern humans might spend an hour a day eating, our ancestors might, like chimpanzees, have spent six.
</li><li>It is likely that 99 percent—or maybe even 99.9 percent—of species ever to exist have gone extinct,
</li><li>Whereas the End-Cretaceous took out an estimated 75 percent of species, the End-Permian event 252 million years ago is estimated to have taken out 96 percent.
</li><li>For one thing, Neanderthals were not stupid and clumsy. They were skilled hunters who could make and use sophisticated weapons and tools. They could control fire, make crude clothing, and construct dwellings. They had complex social groups and probably could use language. They also seem to have, in at least some cases, ritually buried their dead.
</li><li>And no matter where I started my time travels, I would, as I went back in time, expose myself to ancient microorganisms. Because my body had not had an opportunity to develop immunity to them, they might kill me.
</li><li>And ironically, if our descendants, hundreds of thousands of years from now, were to dig up and analyze the bones we twenty-first-century humans leave behind, they might conclude that we didn’t really belong to a species—that we instead represented an intermediate stage between Homo heidelbergensis and the next (yet to have evolved) species.
</li><li>If we visited Earth 4.3 billion years ago, we would probably be confident that there were no living things. If we visited half a billion years later, we would probably be confident that very simple life forms existed. Between those two times, however, we would find it difficult to declare either that life existed or that it didn’t. Instead, we might characterize the things we saw around us as being “lifelike.”
</li><li>According to this panspermia theory, as it is known, life arose elsewhere in the universe and, having arisen, was somehow transported here. There are different ways this might have happened. Perhaps an asteroid struck another planet and blasted pieces of it into space, and those pieces and the living organisms they carried ultimately ended up on Earth. Or maybe alien beings—ancient astronauts, if you will17—visited Earth in the past and brought life with them.
</li><li>consider Proxima Centauri, the star that is the sun’s closest neighbor. Suppose it has a planet that harbors intelligent life, and suppose its inhabitants decide to come visit us. If they travel in rocket ships, the way we do, it might take them a hundred thousand years to reach Earth.
</li><li>And realize that whereas the moon is 1.3 light-seconds away, Proxima Centauri is 4.3 light-years distant.
</li><li>In fission, one cell simply reorganizes itself into two cells, and in fusion, two cells combine to make one. Measured in this way, a cell’s age will be the time that has passed since its oldest cellular ancestor came alive, meaning that the cells that comprise you have existed—and been alive—for billions of years. It is a remarkable achievement. Furthermore,
</li><li>He goes on to estimate that in the course of a year, “approximately 98 percent of the atoms in us now will be replaced by other atoms that we take in in our air, food, and drink.”
</li><li>The creation of the moon has played an important role in our own existence. The impact that gave us our moon probably also gave the earth’s axis its 23.5-degree tilt. This tilt, by giving us seasons, makes more of the earth’s surface habitable than would otherwise be the case.
</li><li>It is estimated that the earth is hit daily by 100 tons (91,000 kilograms) of cosmic material. Some of it makes it to the surface of the earth, either as dust or as objects that can subsequently be found, most conspicuously, in Antarctic ice and on the roofs of buildings.6 The rest of the material “burns up” in the atmosphere, maybe as a shooting star.
</li><li>By volume, the earth is only 0.128 percent water, and by weight, it is an even lower percentage than that, since minerals are almost always heavier than water. Gather up all this water into one drop, and it would be only 860 miles (1,380 kilometers) in diameter, not even enough to span the United States
</li><li>has been estimated that we and chimpanzees have about 99 percent of our DNA in common.
</li><li>Bert Hölldobler and Edward O. Wilson’s magnificent book The Ants.
</li><li>We need to keep this in mind if we someday decide to leave Earth to travel to and then inhabit another planet. For us to survive, our spacecraft will have to carry a panoply of living organisms, including not only plants for us to eat and to supply us with oxygen, but all the organisms of the ecosystems those plants require in order to flourish. Our spacecraft would end up resembling Noah’s ark. When all is said and done, it would probably be much more sensible to simply stay on Earth, curb our reproductive ardor, and take good care of our planetary home, than to abandon it in favor of some very distant “promised land.”
</li><li>I would add that although a pencil cannot have meaning, it can be used to do meaningful things, such as make grocery lists or solve a sudoku puzzle. In much the same way, although your life may have no meaning in and of itself, you can use it to do meaningful things. In particular, you can confer meaning on it by living in accordance with a plan you have devised for your life.
</li><li>We inhabit a fundamentally mysterious universe. The most sensible psychological strategy, in such a place, is to embrace its mystery. And if you want to fully appreciate the life you find yourself living, it makes sense for you, at random moments, to pause in whatever you are doing to reflect on the remarkable series of events, described in the preceding pages, that made your life possible. Lucky you!

</h4><ul><li>species,
</li><li>In refusing to acknowledge how things actually are in any moment, perhaps because we don’t want them to be that way, and in attempting to compel a situation or a relationship to be the way we want it to be out of fear that otherwise we may not get our needs met, we are forgetting that most of the time we hardly know what our own way really is; we only think we do.
</li><li>Dropping Ashes on the Buddha, by Stephen Mitchell.
</li><li>The meditation teacher Joseph Goldstein recounts the story of the elementary school teacher who asked her class, “What color is this, children?” as she held up an apple. Many children said red, some said yellow, some said green, but one boy said, “White.” “White?” said the teacher. “Why are you saying white? You can plainly see it is not white.” At which point the boy comes up to the desk, takes a bite out of it, and holds it up for the teacher and the class to see.
</li><li>Nothing is to be clung to as I, me, or mine.
</li><li>   Meditation is not about trying to get anywhere else. It is about allowing yourself to be exactly where you are and as you are, and for the world to be exactly as it is in this moment as well.
</li><li>Every time we become self-absorbed, we get better at becoming self-absorbed and going unconscious. Every time we get anxious, we get better at being anxious.
</li><li>Every time we are able to know a desire as desire, anger as anger, a habit as habit, an opinion as an opinion, a thought as a thought, a mind-spasm as a mind-spasm, or an intense sensation in the body as an intense sensation, we are correspondingly liberated. Nothing else has to happen. We don’t even have to give up the desire or whatever it is. To see it and know it as desire, as whatever it is, is enough.
</li><li>Each moment missed is a moment unlived. Each moment missed makes it more likely I will miss the next moment, and live through it cloaked in mindless habits of automaticity of thinking, feeling, and doing rather than living in, out of, and through awareness.
</li><li>All of Buddhism is oriented toward waking up from the delusions we spin for ourselves and the ones we are conditioned into through past experiences. In awakening, we free ourselves from the suffering and anguish that come from mis-taking the nature of reality through our limited self-oriented views and tendency to grasp and cling to what we desire and to push away what we fear.
</li><li>In one way, perhaps awareness is centered on us, in that we are a localized node of receptivity. In more fundamental ways, it is not. Awareness is without center or periphery, like space itself.
</li><li>Robert Fuller, in a highly elegant analysis in the book Somebodies and Nobodies,
</li><li>We are rather like whirlpools in the river of life. In flowing forward, a river or stream may hit many rocks, branches, or irregularities in the ground, causing whirlpools to spring up spontaneously here and there. Water entering one whirlpool quickly passes through and rejoins the river, eventually joining another whirlpool and moving on. Though for short periods, it seems to be distinguishable as a separate event, the water in the whirlpools is just the river itself. The stability of a whirlpool is only temporary … However, we want to think that this little whirlpool that we are isn’t part of the stream. We want to see ourselves as permanent and stable. Our whole energy goes into trying to protect our supposed separateness. To protect the separateness, we set up artificial, fixed boundaries; as a consequence, we accumulate excess baggage, stuff that slips into our whirlpool and can’t flow out again. So things clog up our whirlpool and the process gets messy … Neighboring whirlpools may get less water because of our frantic holding on …
</li><li>Emptiness means empty of inherent self-existence, in other words, that nothing, no person, no business, no nation, no atom, exists in and of itself as an enduring entity, isolated, absolute, independent of everything else. Nothing! Everything emerges out of the complex play of particular causes and conditions that are themselves always changing.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Monday, February 6, 2023 12:05:07 PM
</h4><ul><li>On one level, wisdom is nothing more profound than an ability to follow one’s own advice.
</li><li>There is now little question that how one uses one’s attention, moment to moment, largely determines what kind of person one becomes.
</li><li>In my view, the realistic goal to be attained through spiritual practice is not some permanent state of enlightenment that admits of no further efforts but a capacity to be free in this moment, in the midst of whatever is happening. If you can do that, you have already solved most of the problems you will encounter in life.
</li><li>Of course, only 25 percent of Americans believe in evolution (while 68 percent believe in the literal existence of Satan).
</li><li>If a split-brain patient’s left hemisphere accepts the divinity of Jesus, but the right doesn’t, are we to imagine that she now harbors two immortal souls, one destined for the company of angels and the other for an eternity in hellfire?
</li><li>But my suffering was entirely the product of my thoughts. Whatever the needs of the moment, I had a choice: I could do what was required calmly, patiently, and attentively, or do it in a state of panic. Every moment of the day—indeed, every moment throughout one’s life—offers an opportunity to be relaxed and responsive or to suffer unnecessarily.
</li><li>The mere fact that you have the leisure to read this book puts you in very rarefied company. Many people on earth at this moment can’t even imagine the freedom that you currently take for granted.
</li><li>Most of us let our negative emotions persist longer than is necessary. Becoming suddenly angry, we tend to stay angry—and this requires that we actively produce the feeling of anger. We do this by thinking about our reasons for being angry—recalling an insult, rehearsing what we should have said to our malefactor, and so forth—and yet we tend not to notice the mechanics of this process. Without continually resurrecting the feeling of anger, it is impossible to stay angry for more than a few moments.
</li><li>The eighth-century Buddhist adept Vimalamitra described three stages of mastery in meditation and how thinking appears in each. The first is like meeting a person you already know; you simply recognize each thought as it arises in consciousness, without confusion. The second is like a snake tied in a knot; each thought, whatever its content, simply unravels on its own. In the third, thoughts become like thieves entering an empty house; even the possibility of being distracted has disappeared.
</li><li>For our purpose, the only differences between a cult and a religion are the numbers of adherents and the degree to which they are marginalized by the rest of society.
</li><li>One of the first things one learns in practicing meditation is that nothing is intrinsically boring—indeed, boredom is simply a lack of attention. Pay sufficient attention, and the mere experience of breathing can reward months and years of steady vigilance.
</li><li>Many people renounce the world because they can’t find a satisfactory place in it, and almost any spiritual teaching can be used to justify a pathological lack of ambition. For someone who has not yet succeeded at anything and who probably fears failure, a doctrine that criticizes the search for worldly success can be very appealing.
</li><li>As I already noted, the discomfort one feels when meeting another’s gaze seems like nothing more than a ramification of the very feeling of being a self.
</li><li>The fact that we pointlessly ruin the lives of nonviolent drug users by incarcerating them, at enormous expense, constitutes one of the great moral failures of our time. (And the fact that we make room for them in our prisons by paroling murderers, rapists, and child molesters makes one wonder whether civilization isn’t simply doomed.)
</li><li>But if they don’t try a psychedelic like psilocybin or LSD at least once in their adult lives, I will wonder whether they had missed one of the most important rites of passage a human being can experience.
</li><li>It is possible, however, if not actually plausible, to seize this evidence from the other end and argue, as Aldous Huxley did in his classic The Doors of Perception, that the primary function of the brain may be eliminative: Its purpose may be to prevent a transpersonal dimension of mind from flooding consciousness, thereby allowing apes like ourselves to make their way in the world without being dazzled at every step by visionary phenomena that are irrelevant to their physical survival.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Tuesday, February 7, 2023 10:06:36 PM
</h4><ul><li>The moment in front of you is just another moment in the universe that exists even when you are not looking at it.
</li><li>One of the most amazing things you will ever realize is that the moment in front of you is not bothering you—you are bothering yourself about the moment in front of you.
</li><li>Objects themselves have no color; it is the light reflecting off them that has the different colors we perceive.
</li><li>The density of a neutron star is so great that if you brought a teaspoon of it down to Earth, it would weigh twelve trillion pounds.
</li><li>You are being given a unique show that took billions of years to create—it’s right in front of you, and you’re complaining about it.
</li><li>Both clinging and resisting keep the mental renderings in your mind. This is very important to understand. Experiential mind was meant to be like a clear TV screen: it renders the image being sent to it. But now you’ve held on to images that are no longer being generated by the outside world. They got stuck in your mind as mental patterns, and as a result, you’re out of harmony with reality.
</li><li>Somebody you like comes up to you and says, “You know, I really like you. You’re very attractive to me, and I enjoy being with you.” That is such a nice experience that you immediately cling to the beautiful things they said. They go back to what they were doing, but you can’t. You can’t focus on your work because the impressions left in your mind keep distracting you. This is the opposite of Be Here Now; you’re practicing Be There Then. You just had a beautiful experience, and you ruined it. You ruined it by holding on to it, like the butterfly. You ruined it by creating a preference about one of life’s experiences. Now every time the phone rings, and it’s not the person who said the nice things, you get disappointed. Be aware that you did this. Somebody said something nice to you, and you couldn’t handle it. You couldn’t just let it be a nice experience. Instead, you clung to it in your mind, and it actually messed you up.
</li><li>The truth is the whole world is a giant Rorschach test. The world is a flow of atoms unfolding in front of you. It’s no more personal than the inkblots. But it’s hitting your samskaras, and that stimulates stored mental and emotional reactions. Now, instead of experiencing what is passing by outside, you are experiencing the likes, dislikes, beliefs, and judgments stored inside. These impressions are so strong that you actually think they are what is really out there, just like the inkblots. The personal mind has taken over your entire life. You are no longer free to enjoy the experiences that are actually happening—you are forced to deal with what your mind says is happening.
</li><li>If you are not expecting anything in particular from a situation, and then something special happens, it can touch you really deeply. It could be a beautiful sunset, the first unexpected kiss, or some other welcome surprise. If it touches you so deeply because you have no samskaras in your mind about the event—you have beginner’s mind. Otherwise, you will be expecting something based on prior experiences, and that will interfere with the spontaneity of the event.
</li><li>On the other hand, if you were not able to process the experience without resisting it, it will stay stuck in the conscious mind and create havoc. If you really resist it, it will get shoved down into the subconscious where it will fester and spread its disturbance throughout the mind. In either case, you are storing what you are afraid of in your mind. If you do this, you will be afraid of your own thoughts. How could you not be? You made a collection of unpleasant thoughts in your mind, and they are going to keep coming back up. Now, in order to live in there, the analytical aspect of mind must be utilized to figure out what needs to happen outside for you to be okay. This is where preferences come from. They are simply attempts to use outside events to solve the fact that you are not doing well inside.
</li><li>The foundational choice we have in life is either constantly control life to compensate for our blockages or devote our lives to getting rid of our blockages.
</li><li>The world in front of you has the power of reality behind it. It is unfolding in accordance to the influences that made it be the way it is, and there are billions of influences going back billions of years. In contrast, you’re just making up how it’s supposed to be based on the impressions you held inside from your past.
</li><li>Your psyche is the net result of all your blockages and how the energy manages to flow through them.
</li><li>They feel they must choose which of these personalities is really them. The answer is quite clear: none of them are you. Please don’t pick one of them and let that choice determine your life. None of your thoughts are more you than any other thought. You are the one who is experiencing the thoughts.
</li><li>Say a psychologist held up a Rorschach inkblot and you got upset about what you saw in it. Is the solution to tell them to stop holding up that piece of paper? That would be ridiculous. You would not solve anything. Yet trying to solve inner problems by rearranging the outside is exactly what everybody is doing.
</li><li>You didn’t really want the job, the money, or the acceptance—you wanted what you thought they would give you. You wanted happiness, joy, and a sense of total well-being.
</li><li>The bottom line is that you’re a beautiful being. You’re a being of great love, light, and inspiration. You are made in the image of God. The god who created the whole universe exists inside of you, but you don’t realize that. You’re lost thinking that the world outside has to be a certain way for you to be okay. This is the human predicament, and nothing is going to meaningfully change until you learn to live from a deeper place. To get out of this predicament, you’ve got some work to do, and the work is on yourself. To quote Rumi, the great thirteenth-century Persian poet, “Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself.”
</li><li>Many of today’s teachers say that to sit in meditation for fifteen minutes in the morning and fifteen minutes in the evening is a good starting point. That alone will create great benefits. Just put aside the time to sit down in a quiet place.
</li><li>Over time, you will find there is a place inside you that is behind the commotion of the storm. You can simply relax and fall back into that place.
</li><li>The highest life you can live is when every single moment that passes before you is better off because it did. Serve the present moment with all your heart and soul. Imagine what the world would be like if everyone did that.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Saturday, February 11, 2023 12:26:14 AM
</h4><ul><li>To live in despair because life is finite or because life has no higher purpose or embedded design is crass ingratitude. To dream up an omniscient creator and devote our life to endless genuflection seems pointless. And wasteful, too: why squander all that love on a phantasm when there seems too little love to go around on Earth as it is? Better to embrace Spinoza’s and Einstein’s solution: simply bow one’s head, tip one’s hat to the elegant laws and mystery of nature, and go about the business of living.
</li><li>Nietzsche’s message to us was to live life in such a way that we would be willing to repeat the same life eternally.
</li><li>“Splendor, rank, and title exercise an all too seductive power over a young girl’s heart luring women into tying a marriage knot…a false step for which they must suffer the hardest punishment the rest of their lives.”
</li><li>The greatest wisdom is to make the enjoyment of the present the supreme object of life because that is the only reality, all else being the play of thought. But we could just as well call it our greatest folly because that which exists only a moment and vanishes as a dream can never be worth a serious effort.
</li><li>Chutzpah: best defined by the renowned story of the boy who murdered his parents and then pleaded for mercy from the court on the grounds that he was an orphan.
</li><li>Julius had an exquisite sensitivity to the phenomenon of “role-lock”: how often had he seen group therapy patients change dramatically but continue to be perceived as the same person by the other group members.
</li><li>“Nietzsche once wrote that a major difference between man and the cow was that the cow knew how to exist, how to live without angst—that is, fear—in the blessed now, unburdened by the past and unaware of the terrors of the future. But we unfortunate humans are so haunted by the past and future that we can only saunter briefly in the now. Do you know why we so yearn for the golden days of childhood? Nietzsche tells us it’s because those childhood days were the carefree days, days free of care, days before we were weighted down by leaden, painful memories, by the debris of the past.
</li><li>“Remember my version of Boyle’s law,” said Julius. “A small amount of anxiety will expand to fill our whole anxiety cavity. Your anxiety feels just as awful as anxiety in others that comes from more obviously calamitous sources.”

</li><li>“The Beautiful Empty Woman,” which made the point that the truly beautiful woman is so often feted and rewarded solely for her appearance that she neglects developing other parts of herself. Her confidence and feelings of success are only skin-deep, and once her beauty fades she realizes she has little to offer: she has developed neither the art of being an interesting person nor that of taking an interest in others. “I make observations, and I’m called a camera,” said Stuart, “and when I say what I feel I’m labeled a controlling man. Talk about feeling cornered.” “I don’t get it, Rebecca,” said Tony. “What’s the big deal here? Why are you freaking out? Stuart’s just saying what you’ve said yourself. How many times have you said you know how to flirt, that it comes naturally to you? I remember your saying that you had an easy time in college and in your law firm because you manipulate men with your sexuality.” “You make me sound like a whore.” Rebecca swiveled suddenly to Philip. “Doesn’t that make you think I’m a whore?” Philip, not distracted from gazing at his favorite spot somewhere on the ceiling, answered quickly, “Schopenhauer said that a highly attractive women, like a highly intelligent man, was absolutely destined to living an isolated life. He pointed out that others are blind with envy and resent the superior person. For that reason, such people never have close friends of their same sex.” “That’s not necessarily true,” said Bonnie. “I’m thinking of Pam, our missing member, who is beautiful too and yet has a large number of close girlfriends.” “Yeah, Philip,” said Tony, “you saying that, to be popular, you have to be dumb or ugly?” “Precisely,” said Philip, “and the wise person will not spend his life or her life pursuing popularity. It is a will-o’-the-wisp. Popularity does not define what is true or what is good; quite the contrary, it’s a leveler, a dumbing down. Far better to search within for one’s values and goals.” “And how about your goals and values?” asked Tony. If Philip noted the surliness in Tony’s question, he gave no evidence of it and replied ingenuously, “Like Schopenhauer, I want to will as little as possible and to know as much as possible.” Tony nodded, obviously baffled about how to respond. Rebecca broke in: “Philip, what you or Schopenhauer was saying about friends was right on the mark for me—the truth is that I’ve had few close girlfriends. But what about two people with similar interests and abilities? Don’t

</li><li>“Plato,” Philip interjected, “observed that love is in the one who loves, not in the one who is loved.”
</li><li>“I try always to keep in mind that we are all sentenced to an existence filled with inescapable misery—an existence which none of us would choose if we knew the facts ahead of time. In that sense we are all, as Schopenhauer put it, fellow sufferers, and we stand in need of tolerance and love from our neighbors in life.” “Schopenhauer again! Philip, I hear too damn much about Schopenhauer—whoever he is—and too damn little about you.” Tony spoke calmly, as though imitating Philip’s measured tone, yet his breathing was shallow and rapid. Generally, confrontation came easily to Tony; at the time he began therapy scarcely a week passed without a physical contretemps in a bar, in traffic, at work, or on the basketball court. Though not a large man, he was fearless in confrontation; except for one situation—a clash of ideas with an educated articulate bully, someone exactly like Philip. Philip gave no sign he intended to respond to Tony. Julius broke the silence. “Tony, you seem deep in thought. What’s running through your mind? “I was thinking about what Bonnie said earlier in the meeting about missing Pam. Me, too. I been missing her today.” Julius was not surprised. Tony had become accustomed to Pam’s tutelage and protection. The two of them had had struck up an odd-couple relationship—the English professor and the tattooed primitive. Using an oblique approach, Julius said, “Tony, I imagine it’s not easy for you to say, ‘Schopenhauer, whoever that is.’” “Well, we’re here to tell the truth,” Tony responded.
</li><li>“I try always to keep in mind that we are all sentenced to an existence filled with inescapable misery—an existence which none of us would choose if we knew the facts ahead of time. In that sense we are all, as Schopenhauer put it, fellow sufferers, and we stand in need of tolerance and love from our neighbors in life.”

</li><li>Work, worry, toil and trouble are certainly the lot of almost all throughout their lives. But if all desires were fulfilled as soon as they arose, how then would people occupy their lives and spend their time? Suppose the human race were removed to Utopia where everything grew automatically and pigeons flew about ready-roasted; where everyone at once found his sweetheart and had no difficulty in keeping her; then people would die of boredom or hang themselves; or else they would fight, throttle, and murder one another and so cause themselves more suffering than is now laid upon them by nature.
</li><li>At that time I didn’t know that heightened sexuality is a common response to confrontation with death.
</li><li>Last night I read something interesting, a passage in Nabokov’s memoir, Speak, Memory, which described life as a spark between two identical pools of darkness, the darkness before we were born and the darkness after we die. And how odd it is that we have so much concern about the latter and so little about the former.
</li><li>When, on a sea voyage, the ship is brought to anchor, you go out to fetch water and gather a few roots and shells by the way. But you always need to keep your mind fixed on the ship, and constantly to look around, lest at any time the master of the ship call, and you must heed that call and cast away all those things, lest you be treated like the sheep that are bound and thrown into the hold. So it is with human life also. And if there be available wife and children instead of shells and roots, nothing should hinder us from taking them. But if the master call, run to the ship, forsaking all those things, and without looking behind. And if thou be in old age, go not far from the ship at any time, lest the master should call, and thou be not ready.

</li><li>When Sartre was offered the Légion d’honneur for his Resistance activities in 1945, and the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1964, he rejected them both, citing a writer’s need to stay independent of interests and influences.
</li><li>So what exactly is phenomenology? It is essentially a method rather than a set of theories, and — at the risk of wildly oversimplifying — its basic approach can be conveyed through a two-word command: DESCRIBE PHENOMENA.
</li><li>For Sartre, if we try to shut ourselves up inside our own minds, ‘in a nice warm room with the shutters closed’, we cease to exist. We have no cosy home: being out on the dusty road is the very definition of what we are.
</li><li>In his essay ‘On the Ontological Mystery’, written in 1932 and published in the fateful year of 1933, Marcel wrote of the human tendency to become stuck in habits, received ideas, and a narrow-minded attachment to possessions and familiar scenes. Instead, he urged his readers to develop a capacity for remaining ‘available’ to situations as they arise.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Wednesday, February 15, 2023 8:43:26 PM
</h4><ul><li>I think that life would suddenly seem wonderful to us if we were threatened to die as you say. Just think of how many projects, travels, love affairs, studies, it—our life—hides from us, made invisible by our laziness which, certain of a future, delays them incessantly. But let all this threaten to become impossible for ever, how beautiful it would become again! Ah! if only the cataclysm doesn’t happen this time, we won’t miss visiting the new galleries of the Louvre, throwing ourselves at the feet of Miss X, making a trip to India.
</li><li>In reality, every reader is, while he is reading, the reader of his own self. The writer’s work is merely a kind of optical instrument which he offers to the reader to enable him to discern what, without this book, he would perhaps never have experienced in himself. And the recognition by the reader in his own self of what the book says is the proof of its veracity.
</li><li>“When one is sad, it is lovely to lie in the warmth of one’s bed, and there, with all effort and struggle at an end, even perhaps with one’s head under the blankets, surrender completely to wailing, like branches in the autumn wind.”
</li><li>There is no man, however wise, who has not at some period of his youth said things, or even lived in a way which was so unpleasant to him in later life that he would gladly, if he could, expunge it from his memory. But he shouldn’t regret this entirely, because he cannot be certain that he has indeed become a wise man—so far as any of us can be wise—unless he has passed through all the fatuous or unwholesome incarnations by which that ultimate stage must be reached. I know there are young people … whose teachers have instilled in them a nobility of mind and moral refinement from the very beginning of their schooldays. They perhaps have nothing to retract when they look back upon their lives; they can, if they choose, publish a signed account of everything they have ever said or done; but they are poor creatures, feeble descendants of doctrinaires, and their wisdom is negative and sterile. We cannot be taught wisdom, we have to discover it for ourselves by a journey which no one can undertake for us, an effort which no one can spare us.
</li><li>“Happiness is good for the body,” Proust tells us, “but it is grief which develops the strengths of the mind.”
</li><li>Sometimes in the afternoon sky, a white moon would creep up like a little cloud, furtive, without display, suggesting an actress who does not have to “come on” for a while, and so goes “in front” in her ordinary clothes to watch the rest of the company for a moment, but keeps in the background, not wishing to attract attention to herself
</li><li>If, as Proust suggests, we are obliged to create our own language, it is because there are dimensions to ourselves absent from clichés, which require us to flout etiquette in order to convey with greater accuracy the distinctive timbre of our thought.
</li><li>If the rich are fortunate in being able to travel to Dresden as soon as the desire to do so arises, or to buy a dress just after they have seen it in a catalog, they are cursed because of the speed with which their wealth fulfills their desires. No sooner have they thought of Dresden than they can be on a train there; no sooner have they seen a dress than it can be in their wardrobe. They therefore have no opportunity to suffer the interval between desire and gratification which the less privileged endure, and which, for all its apparent unpleasantness, has the incalculable benefit of allowing people to know and fall deeply in love with paintings in Dresden, hats, dressing gowns, and someone who isn’t free this evening.
</li><li>a genuine homage to Proust would be to look at our world through his eyes, not to look at his world through our eyes.
</li><li>To make [reading] into a discipline is to give too large a role to what is only an incitement. Reading is on the threshold of the spiritual life; it can introduce us to it: it does not constitute it.

</li><li>We seem to be predisposed to remember statements as true even after they have been disconfirmed. For instance, if a rumor spreads that a famous politician once fainted during a campaign speech, and the story is later revealed to be false, some significant percentage of people will recall it as a fact—even if they were first exposed to it in the very context of its debunking. In psychology, this is known as the “illusory truth effect.” Familiarity breeds credence.

</li><li>The quickest way to stop noticing something may be to buy it – just as the quickest way to stop appreciating a person may be to marry them.
</li><li>Life seems a process of replacing one anxiety with another and substituting one desire for another – which is not to say that we should never strive to overcome any anxieties or fulfil any desires, but that we should perhaps build into our strivings an awareness of the way our goals promise us levels of rest and resolution that they cannot, by definition, deliver.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Tuesday, February 21, 2023 11:00:50 PM
</h4><ul><li>To qualify as true, a doctrine or claim must be known by immediate experience. Mere belief, according to the Buddha, was not enough when it comes to matters of ultimate significance.
</li><li>The implication of the Buddha’s story is that he found monotheistic claims about a divine being with ultimacy, omnipotence, and singularity to be untenable.
</li><li>Because change occurs so rapidly and so thoroughly, and because all items of experience are dependent on other items, just as photosynthesis depends on the sun, it is misleading and technically wrong to call a tree a thing. There is nothing about a tree that warrants saying it has its own existence, since it depends on so much that is not-tree, like air, light, soil, and water, and since no particular form of it endures over time—not even a moment, however that would be defined. Imputing thinghood to these, these (one wants to say “things”!—and that proves the point) these “aspects” of experience is a function of our language and thinking processes.
</li><li>Perfecting wisdom and compassion, to put it as concisely as possible, is the way to nibbana and the end of suffering.
</li><li>Like Confucius, the Buddha thought that ethical conduct ought to be founded on the human desire to realize the good rather than on the fear of retribution.
</li><li>The Buddha felt no urge to compel anyone to accept his teaching. If anyone criticized his dhamma, he responded calmly and politely and tried to explain why he did what he did and thought what he thought. He told his students, “If anyone should criticize me, the dhamma, or the sangha, do not be angry, resentful, or upset. For if you were, that would darken your judgment, and you would be unable to know whether what they said was right or wrong.”
</li><li>When the writer Stewart Alsop was contemplating his own death from leukemia, he wrote, “A dying man needs to die, as a sleepy man needs to sleep, and there comes a time when it is wrong, as well as useless, to resist.”
</li><li>The image often associated with parinibbana is the extinguishing of a candle flame. The flame is a consequence of various elements coming together: the wick, oxygen, and heat. When these constituents are exhausted—when the supply of oxygen is cut off, when the wick is burned out, when the heat has been cooled—the flame is gone. It makes as much sense to ask, “where does the Buddha go after death? as it does to ask, Where does the flame go? The flame is not an entity that can “go” anywhere. The Buddha is simply not here.
</li><li>Buddhism became a dominant cultural and religious force in India until the twelfth through the fourteenth centuries CE, when it became all but extinct in the country of its birth.
</li><li>The Qur’an was essentially the first work written in Arabic of any significance.
</li><li>“Until the mid-twentieth century, China was so inseparable from the idea of Confucius that her scheme of government and society, her concept of self and human relationships, and her construct of culture and history all seemed to have originated from his mind alone.”
</li><li>During this period, which is known as the Axial Age (800‒200 BCE), metaphysical conceptions such as god, rebirth, and the afterlife came to be closely associated with moral human behavior.
</li><li>As the story goes, a student approached Confucius to ask how to serve the gods and the ancestors. The Master responded: “You are not able even to serve your fellow humans. How can you ask about the gods and spirits?” When the student went on to ask about death, the Master said, “You do not understand even life. How can you understand death?”
</li><li>For Confucius, matters such as living circumstances, wealth, and fame were determined by heaven, not by the individual. We have no control over these situations, but we can choose to respond to those circumstances with dignity and nobility.
</li><li>Confucius admonished his students to live simply, without ostentation or luxury, as he himself did. He said, “A gentleman seeks neither a full belly nor a comfortable home. He is quick in action but cautious in speech.”
</li><li>The Pharisees also maintained a belief in the resurrection of the dead, an idea that developed rather late in ancient Judaism; it is not mentioned in the earliest Jewish scripture.
</li><li>Some estimates suggest that the commoners had to forfeit one-half to two-thirds of their annual productivity to Rome and its Jewish collaborators. Peasant life was obviously precarious; a drought could easily thrust a peasant family into the lowest stratum of society, reducing them to begging for alms. The life expectancy for a peasant was a mere thirty years.
</li><li>First, virtually all credible scholars believe there actually was a person living in ancient Palestine whom modern people now know as Jesus. Few historians doubt that he existed.
</li><li>There are over a dozen such stories in the Infancy Gospel. A final tale involves Jesus and a friend playing on the roof of a house, when the other boy accidentally fell off and died. Given his reputation in the village, the parents of the dead boy arrived and accused Jesus of killing him. Jesus, rightly, insisted on his innocence. He suddenly jumped down from the roof and shouted at the dead boy: “Zeno! . . .Get up and tell me: Did I push you?”201 Suddenly Zeno returns to life and says, “No, Lord, you didn’t push me, you raised me up.”
</li><li>Contrary to the popular mythology of later Christianity, Jesus never spoke of human beings going to heaven. He said nothing about souls being transported to the celestial regions after death. He did, however, indicate that the kingdom of heaven would come to earth. It was here that the divine reign would be realized, not somewhere beyond the skies.
</li><li>Jesus seemed to view prayer principally as a discipline for subordinating his desires to divine wisdom rather than as an opportunity to enlist the divine Father’s assistance in fulfilling a personal wish-list.
</li><li>The New Testament relates that Jesus, like the Buddha and Muhammad, craved solitude and used every opportunity to steal away from the crowds to be alone.
</li><li>Jesus was quite clear that wealth was a serious impediment to participation in the LORD’s kingdom. On numerous occasions, he urged those with wealth to give it all away and those without it to be happy with what they had.
</li><li>Almost certainly, Jesus thought of himself as a son of god, but there is little definitive evidence to compel us to say that he thought of sonship as a unique relationship that only he had with the Father.
</li><li>The idea that Jesus was a divine incarnation is a christological development that appears many decades after Jesus’s death, long after the Christian movement had gained a foothold in other parts of the Roman world.

</li><li>I had experienced similar hours in the past.

</li><li>I now accepted the hours of despair as one accepts acute physical pain; one endures it, complainingly or defiantly; one feels it swell and increase, and sometimes there is a raging or mocking curiosity as to how much further it can go, to what extent the pain can still increase.

</li><li>Oh, the endless labor of the intellectual—pouring all this knowledge into the brain through a three-millimeter aperture in the iris.”
</li><li>Too much authority, too many prestigious opinions and conclusions oppress one’s own imaginative synthetic powers. For much the same reason, I prefer to read a play before seeing it performed and certainly before reading reviews.
</li><li>“Each person owns his own death. And each should enact it in his own way. Perhaps—only perhaps—there is a right by which we can take a man’s life. But there is no right by which we can take a man’s death. That is not comfort. That is cruelty!”
</li><li>“Thoughts are the shadows of our feelings—always darker, emptier and simpler.”
</li><li>“I can’t find the passage now, but its point is that the seeker after truth must undergo a personal psychological analysis—he terms it ‘moral dissection.’ In fact, he goes so far as to say that the errors of even the greatest philosophers were caused by ignorance of their own motivation. He claims that in order to discover the truth, one must first know oneself fully. And to do that, one must remove oneself from one’s customary point of view, even from one’s own century and country—and then examine oneself from a distance!”
</li><li>Perhaps you think of those you love. Dig deeper, and you will learn that you do not love them: what you love is the pleasant sensations such love produces in you! You love desire, not the desired.
</li><li>“I know that, Professor Nietzsche, and I don’t expect cure, merely relief. I want you to advise me. I want you to show me how to tolerate a life of despair.”
</li><li>Breuer winced. How could he admit to having wagered his whole life only to find that the final prize was, after all, not to his liking? No, these things he must keep to himself. There are things you don’t tell the young ones.
</li><li>“Here you say you are overconcerned with the opinions of your colleagues. I have known many who dislike themselves and try to rectify this by first persuading others to think well of them. Once that is done, then they begin to think well of themselves. But this is a false solution, this is submission to the authority of others. Your task is to accept yourself—not to find ways to gain my acceptance.”
</li><li>“Look deeper, and you will see that lust is also a lust for dominance over all others. The ‘lover’ is not one who ‘loves’: instead, he aims for sole possession of his loved one. His wish is to exclude the entire world from some precious good. He is as mean-spirited as the dragon guarding his golden hoard! He does not love the world—on the contrary, he is utterly indifferent to all other living creatures.
</li><li>Our responsibility to life is to create the higher, not to reproduce the lower. Nothing must interfere with the development of the hero inside of you. And if lust stands in the way, then it, too, must be overcome.”
</li><li>You must choose between comfort and true inquiry! If you choose science, if you choose to be liberated from the soothing chains of the supernatural, if, as you claim, you choose to eschew belief and embrace godlessness, then you cannot in the same breath yearn for the small comforts of the believer! If you kill God, you must also leave the shelter of the temple.”

</li><li>He didn’t know what to do with Nietzsche’s words, but he knew they reached him, moved him.
</li><li>‘In the presence of Bertha’s beauty, I feel—I feel—’ What do I feel? I feel I’m in the bowels of the earth—in the center of existence. I’m just where I should be. I’m in the place where there are no questions about life or purpose—the center—the place of safety. Her beauty offers infinite safety.”
</li><li>“Living safely is dangerous.
</li><li>“Meaning that I was never weighed down by carrying my father on my back, never suffocated by the burden of his judgment, never taught that the object of life was to fulfill his thwarted ambitions. His death may well have been a blessing, a liberation. His whims never became my law. I was left alone to discover my own path, one not trodden before. Think about it! Could I, the antichrist, have exorcized false beliefs and sought new truths with a parson-father wincing with pain at my every achievement, a father who would have regarded my campaigns against illusion as a personal attack against him?”
</li><li>It’s much like the question of the sound of a tree falling in an empty forest. Does unobserved activity have meaning?”
</li><li>“These questions—you know the answer! No, I’ve not chosen! No, I’ve not lived the life I’ve wanted! I’ve lived the life assigned me. I—the real I—have been encased in my life.”
</li><li>Think about infinity. Look behind you—imagine looking infinitely far into the past. Time stretches backward for all eternity. And, if time infinitely stretches backward, must not everything that can happen have already happened? Must not all that passes now have passed this way before? Whatever walks here, mustn’t it have walked this path before? And if everything has passed before in time’s infinity, then what do you think, Josef, of this moment, of our whispering together under this arch of trees? Must not this, too, have come before? And time that stretches back infinitely, must it not also stretch ahead infinitely? Must not we, in this moment, in every moment, recur eternally?”
</li><li>“Yes, eternal recurrence means that every time you choose an action you must be willing to choose it for all eternity. And it is the same for every action not made, every stillborn thought, every choice avoided. And all unlived life will remain bulging inside you, unlived through all eternity. And the unheeded voice of your conscience will cry out to you forever.”
</li><li>“I meant only that, to fully relate to another, one must first relate to oneself. If we cannot embrace our own aloneness, we will simply use the other as a shield against isolation. Only when one can live like the eagle—with no audience whatsoever—can one turn to another in love; only then is one able to care about the enlargement of the other’s being.
</li><li>“It’s strange, but at the very moment when I, for the first time in my life, reveal my loneliness in all its depth, in all its despair—at that precise moment, loneliness melts away!
</li><li>The best new fiction I’ve read in several years is the novel Cloud Atlas, by David Mitchell—a work of genius. I’ve been reading and loving several books by Murakami, Roth, and Paul Auster. And I’ve just reread Our Mutual Friend, by Charles Dickens, and The German Lesson, by Siegfried Lenz—what masterpieces!

</h4><ul><li>It seems to me that in the majority of instances it happens like this: people live as everyone lives, but on the basis of principles that not only have nothing in common with religious doctrines but are, on the whole, contrary to them; religious doctrine plays no part in life, or in relations between people, neither are we confronted with it in our personal lives. Religious doctrine is professed in some other realm, at a distance from life and independent of it. If we encounter it, it is only as an external phenomenon, disconnected from life.
</li><li>My life came to a standstill. I could breathe, eat, drink and sleep and I could not help breathing, eating, drinking and sleeping; but there was no life in me because I had no desires whose gratification I would have deemed it reasonable to fulfil. If I wanted something I knew in advance that whether or not I satisfied my desire nothing would come of it.
</li><li>It is only possible to go on living while you are intoxicated with life; once sober it is impossible not to see that it is all a mere trick, and a stupid trick!
</li><li>‘The life of the body is evil and a lie. And since the annihilation of the life of the body is a blessing we must long for it,’ says Socrates.
</li><li>To deceive oneself is pointless. All is vanity. Happy is he who was never born. Death is better than life; one must free oneself from it.
</li><li>Where there is life there is faith. Since the day of creation faith has made it possible for mankind to live, and the essential aspects of that faith are always and everywhere the same.
</li><li>If it were not so frightening it would be amusing to observe the pride and complacency with which we, like children, take apart the watch, pull out the spring and make a toy of it, and are then surprised when the watch stops working.
</li><li>Despite our intelligence the contentions of Schopenhauer, Solomon and myself were foolish: we considered life to be evil and nevertheless continued to live. This was apparent stupidity because, if life is meaningless and I am so fond of reason, then I must destroy life so that no one can deny it.
</li><li>The life of the world runs according to someone’s will; our lives and the lives of everything in existence are in someone else’s hands. In order to have any chance of comprehending this will we must first fulfil it by doing what is asked of us. If I do not do what is asked of me I will never understand what it is that is asked of me, and still less what is asked of us all, of the whole world.
</li><li>To know God and to live are one and the same thing. God is life.
</li><li>This meaning, if it is possible to describe, is as follows. Every person comes into the world through the will of God. And God created man in such a way that each of us can either destroy his soul or save it. Man’s purpose in life is to save his soul; in order to save his soul he must live according to God.

</li><li>‘Most men will not swim before they are able to.’ Is not that witty? Naturally, they won’t swim! They are born for the solid earth, not for the water. And naturally they won’t think. They are made for life, not for thought. Yes, and he who thinks, what’s more, he who makes thought his business, he may go far in it, but he has bartered the solid earth for the water all the same, and one day he will drown.”
</li><li>A wolf of the Steppes that had lost its way and strayed into the towns and the life of the herd, a more striking image could not be found for his shy loneliness, his savagery, his restlessness, his homesickness, his homelessness.
</li><li>For what I always hated and detested and cursed above all things was this contentment, this healthiness and comfort, this carefully preserved optimism of the middle classes, this fat and prosperous brood of mediocrity.
</li><li>Here, too, I found neither home nor company, nothing but a seat from which to view a stage where strange people played strange parts.
</li><li>And this too was odd: that somewhere in a green valley vines were tended by good, strong fellows and the wine pressed so that here and there in the world, far away, a few disappointed, quietly drinking townsfolk and dispirited Steppenwolves could sip a little heart and courage from their glasses.
</li><li>The man of power is ruined by power, the man of money by money, the submissive man by subservience, the pleasure seeker by pleasure.
</li><li>As thousands of his like do, he found consolation and support, and not merely the melancholy play of youthful fancy, in the idea that the way to death was open to him at any moment. It is true that with him, as with all men of his kind, every shock, every pain, every untoward predicament at once called forth the wish to find an escape in death. By degrees, however, he fashioned for himself out of this tendency a philosophy that was actually serviceable to life. He gained strength through familiarity with the thought that the emergency exit stood always open, and became curious, too, to taste his suffering to the dregs. If it went too badly with him he could feel sometimes with a grim malicious pleasure: “I am curious to see all the same just how much a man can endure. If the limit of what is bearable is reached, I have only to open the door to escape.”
</li><li>Harry consists of a hundred or a thousand selves, not of two. His life oscillates, as everyone’s does, not merely between two poles, such as the body and the spirit, the saint and the sinner, but between thousand and thousands.
</li><li>Man is not capable of thought in any high degree, and even the most spiritual and highly cultivated of men habitually sees the world and himself through the lenses of delusive formulas and artless simplifications—and most of all himself. For it appears to be an inborn and imperative need of all men to regard the self as a unit. However often and however grievously this illusion is shattered, it always mends again. The judge who sits over the murderer and looks into his face, and at one moment recognizes all the emotions and potentialities and possibilities of the murderer in his own soul and hears the murderer’s voice as his own, is at the next moment one and indivisible as the judge, and scuttles back into the shell of his cultivated self and does his duty and condemns the murderer to death.
</li><li>He is resolved to forget that the desperate clinging to the self and the desperate clinging to life are the surest way to eternal death, while the power to die, to strip one’s self naked, and the eternal surrender of the self bring immortality with them.
</li><li>And while I, Harry Haller, stood there in the street, flattered and surprised and studiously polite and smiling into the good fellow’s kindly, short-sighted face, there stood the other Harry, too, at my elbow and grinned likewise. He stood there and grinned as he thought what a funny, crazy, dishonest fellow I was to show my teeth in rage and curse the whole world one moment and, the next, to be falling all over myself in the eagerness of my response to the first amiable greeting of the first good honest fellow who came my way, to be wallowing like a suckling-pig in the luxury of a little pleasant feeling and friendly esteem.
</li><li>Obeying is like eating and drinking. There’s nothing like it if you’ve been without it too long.
</li><li>“Fine views of life, you have. You have always done the difficult and complicated things and the simple ones you haven’t even learned. No time, of course. More amusing things to do. Well, thank God, I’m not your mother. But to do as you do and then say you’ve tested life to the bottom and found nothing in it is going a bit too far.”
</li><li>“Like all great spirits, Herr von Goethe, you have clearly recognised and felt the riddle and the hopelessness of human life, with its moments of transcendence that sink again to wretchedness, and the impossibility of rising to one fair peak of feeling except at the cost of many days’ enslavement to the daily round; and, then, the ardent longing for the realm of the spirit in eternal and deadly war with the equally ardent and holy love of the lost innocence of nature, the whole frightful suspense in vacancy and uncertainty, this condemnation to the transient that can never be valid, that is ever experimental and dilettantish; in short, the utter lack of purpose to which the human state is condemned—to its consuming despair. You have known all this, yes, and said as much over and over again; yet you gave up your whole life to preaching its opposite, giving utterance to faith and optimism and spreading before yourself and others the illusion that our spiritual strivings mean something and endure.
</li><li>“You take the old Goethe much too seriously, my young friend. You should not take old people who are already dead seriously. It does them injustice. We immortals do not like things to be taken seriously. We like joking. Seriousness, young man, is an accident of time. It consists, I don’t mind telling you in confidence, in putting too high a value on time. I, too, once put too high a value on time. For that reason I wished to be a hundred years old. In eternity, however, there is no time, you see. Eternity is a mere moment, just long enough for a joke.”
</li><li>To be religious you must have time and, even more, independence of time. You can’t be religious in earnest and at the same time live in actual things and still take them seriously, time and money and the Odeon Bar and all that.”
</li><li>But it’s a poor fellow who can’t take his pleasure without asking other people’s permission.”
</li><li>It is certain in any case that life is quite disarmed by the gift to live so entirely in the present, to treasure with such eager care every flower by the wayside and the light that plays on every passing moment.
</li><li>“Well, look at an animal, a cat, a dog, or a bird, or one of those beautiful great beasts in the zoo, a puma or a giraffe. You can’t help seeing that all of them are right. They’re never in any embarrassment. They always know what to do and how to behave themselves. They don’t flatter and they don’t intrude. They don’t pretend. They are as they are, like stones or flowers or stars in the sky.
</li><li>The few capacities and pursuits in which I had happened to be strong had occupied all my attention, and I had painted a picture of myself as a person who was in fact nothing more than a most refined and educated specialist in poetry, music and philosophy; and as such I had lived, leaving all the rest of me to be a chaos of potentialities, instincts and impulses which I found an encumbrance and gave the label of Steppenwolf.
</li><li>These pictures—there were hundreds of them, with names and without—all came back. They rose fresh and new out of this night of love, and I knew again, what in my wretchedness I had forgotten, that they were my life’s possession and all its worth. Indestructible and abiding as the stars, these experiences, though forgotten, could never be erased. Their series was the story of my life, their starry light the undying value of my being. My life had become weariness. It had wandered in a maze of unhappiness that led to renunciation and nothingness; it was bitter with the salt of all human things; yet it had laid up riches, riches to be proud of. It had been for all its wretchedness a princely life. Let the little way to death be as it might, the kernel of this life of mine was noble. It had purpose and character and turned not on trifles, but on the stars.
</li><li>Ah, Harry, we have to stumble through so much dirt and humbug before we reach home. And we have no one to guide us. Our only guide is our homesickness.”
</li><li>For the first time I understood Goethe’s laughter, the laughter of the immortals. It was a laughter without an object. It was simply light and lucidity. It was that which is left over when a true man has passed through all the sufferings, vices, mistakes, passions and misunderstandings of men and got through to eternity and the world of space. And eternity was nothing else than the redemption of time, its return to innocence, so to speak, and its transformation again into space.
</li><li>You have no doubt guessed long since that the conquest of time and the escape from reality, or however else it may be that you choose to describe your longing, means simply the wish to be relieved of your so-called personality. That is the prison where you lie.
</li><li>I say to myself: all we who ask too much and have a dimension too many could not contrive to live at all if there were not another air to breathe outside the air of this world, if there were not eternity at the back of time; and this is the kingdom of truth. The music of Mozart belongs there and the poetry of your great poets. The saints, too, belong there, who have worked wonders and suffered martyrdom and given a great example to men. But the image of every true act, the strength of every true feeling, belongs to eternity just as much, even though no one knows of it or sees it or records it or hands it down to posterity. In eternity there is no posterity.”

</li><li>I’ve known many gifted children of immigrants who have a sense of being lilies growing in a swamp—beautiful flowers but no deep roots.”
</li><li>So Ursula, whom I remembered well, thought I was a beautiful boy with coal black hair! Me? Beautiful? If only I had known! Never, not for a moment, had I ever thought of myself as a beautiful boy. I was shy, nerdish, lacking in self-confidence, and never imagined that anyone found me attractive. Oh, Ursula, bless you. Bless you for telling me I was beautiful. But, why, oh why, didn’t you speak up earlier? It might have changed my entire childhood!
</li><li>I think of religions and the ideas of the afterlife as the world’s longest-running con game. It serves a purpose—it provides religious leaders a comfortable life and it dampens mankind’s fears of death. But it comes at such a price—it infantilizes us, it blocks our vision of the natural order.
</li><li>I’ve always been uneasy in confrontation, personally and professionally, and have carefully avoided any administrative position that might require it—for example, a chairmanship, committee head, or deanship.
</li><li>Memoirs, no doubt this one as well, are far more fictional than we like to think.
</li><li>My deepest pleasure was to lose myself in the world of a novel, and over and over again I told myself that the very best thing a person could do in life was to write a fine novel.
</li><li>The sharp salary discrepancy between Stanford and UCSF shocked me at first, but as I pondered my two offers, it ceased to be a factor. Though we had zero savings and lived from paycheck to paycheck, money was not a major concern.
</li><li>I had just witnessed a simple but extraordinarily important phenomenon: all the group members being exposed to a single stimulus (in this instance, a leader asking that all comments remain in the here-and-now), and the members responding in very different ways. A single shared stimulus and eleven different responses! Why? There was only one possible solution to this puzzle: There are eleven different inner worlds! And these eleven different responses may be the royal road into these different worlds.
</li><li>Economics were so different then: with a small income, we had no difficulty buying a home on an acre of land for $32,000. The price was three times my annual Stanford income; today, the Palo Alto economy has changed so much that an equivalent home would cost thirty to forty times a young professor’s salary.
</li><li>Leo Tolstoy’s Death of Ivan Ilyich,
</li><li>A rabbi had a conversation with the Lord about Heaven and Hell. “I will show you Hell,” said the Lord, and he led the rabbi into a room containing a large round table. The people sitting around the table were famished and desperate. In the middle of the table was an enormous pot of stew that smelled so delicious that the rabbi’s mouth watered. Each person around the table held a spoon with a very long handle. Although the long spoons just reached the pot, their handles were longer than the would-be diners’ arms: thus, unable to bring food to their lips, no one could eat. The rabbi saw that their suffering was terrible indeed. “Now I will show you Heaven,” said the Lord, and they went into another room, exactly the same as the first. There was the same large round table, the same pot of stew. The people were equipped with the same long-handled spoons—but here everyone was well nourished and plump, laughing and talking. The rabbi could not understand. “It is simple, but it requires a certain skill,” said the Lord. “In this room, you see, they have learned to feed each other.”
</li><li>It is also a striking example of the concept of “rippling” that helps many attenuate the terror of death. Rippling refers to passing parts of our self on to others, even to others whom we do not know, much as the ripples caused by a pebble in a pond go on and on until they are no longer visible but continue at a nano level.
</li><li>“What a pity I had to wait until now, until my body was riddled with cancer, to learn how to live.”
</li><li>On many occasions I have employed an explicit exercise: I ask the patient to draw a line on a sheet of paper, and then I say, “Let one end represent your birth and the other end your death. Now please place a mark on the line to denote where you are now and meditate on that diagram.” This exercise rarely fails to incite deeper awareness of life’s precious transiency.
</li><li>I ended my afterword to a new edition of Love’s Executioner with an observation my younger self would have found surprising: namely, that the view from eighty is better than expected. Yes, I can’t deny that life in the later years is just one damn loss after another; but, even so, I’ve found far greater tranquility and happiness in my seventh, and eighth, and ninth decades than I had ever thought possible.
</li><li>I decided to discuss the work of Epicurus in a nonfiction book on death anxiety, and that book gradually morphed into Staring at the Sun, published in 2008.
</li><li>During this time I comforted myself with a thought experiment suggested by Richard Dawkins: Imagine a laser-thin spotlight moving inexorably along the immense ruler of time. Everything that the beam has passed is lost in the darkness of the past; everything ahead of the spotlight is hidden in the darkness of that yet to be. Only that which is illuminated by the laser-thin spot of light is alive and aware.
</li><li>I sometimes think the very act of writing is my effort to dispel the passage of time and inevitable death. Faulkner put it best: “The aim of every artist is to arrest motion and hold it fixed so that at some point a stranger reads it and it comes back to life again.”
</li><li>In fact, Goethe had mentioned in one of his letters that he carried Spinoza’s Ethics in his pocket for an entire year!

And his professional duties and the whole arrangement of his life and of his family, and all his social and official interests, might all have been false. He tried to defend all those things to himself and suddenly felt the weakness of what he was defending. There was nothing to defend.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Sunday, March 12, 2023 12:19:39 PM
</h4><ul><li>A moralist is not a moralizer. The latter has the answer before he is asked the question, while the former has only questions after she hears the available answers.
</li><li>“Judging whether or not life is worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy.”
</li><li>The genius of Greek tragedy is that it refuses answers or resolutions. Instead, its value lies in its ability “to describe and see the conflict clearly and to acknowledge that there is no way out. The best the agent can do is to have his suffering, the natural expression of his goodness of character, and not to stifle these responses out of misguided optimism.”
</li><li>Even an absurd god, Kierkegaard confesses, is preferable to an unfathomable void.
</li><li>The question, Camus concludes, is “to find out if it is possible to live without appeal.”
</li><li>From the heights of his youth, Camus affirmed: “To observe that life is absurd cannot be an end, but only a beginning.… What interests me is not this discovery [of life’s absurd character], but the consequences and rules of action we must draw from it.”
</li><li>Absurdity is the child of disparity. It rises before us when our expectations fall short of reality. From the simplest to the most complex case, writes Camus, “the magnitude of the absurdity will be in direct ratio to the distance between the two terms of my comparison.”
</li><li>“For the first time, in that night alive with signs and stars, I opened myself to the tender indifference of the world.”
</li><li>In his idiosyncratic but often compelling work The World of Silence, Max Picard insists that silence is not simply negative—the mere absence of speech or what we do not hear when others stop talking, machines stop whirring, radios and screens stop making noise. On the contrary, it exists independently of language and noise; it is a “a complete world in itself. Silence has greatness simply because it is. It is, and that is its greatness, its pure greatness.”
</li><li>“Among the columns of lengthening shadows, worries fell from the sky like wounded birds and were replaced by an arid lucidity.”
</li><li>For the young Camus who had not yet visited Kabylia, nature in its benign severity forced us to confront life in its stark simplicity: “Between this sky and the faces turned toward it there is nothing on which to hang a mythology, a literature, an ethic, or a religion—only stones, flesh, stars, and those truths the hand can touch.”
</li><li>“I owe to Nietzsche a part of who I am,” he acknowledged, gratefully.
</li><li>The classicist Ulrich von Wilamowitz once affirmed: “To make the ancients speak, we must feed them with our own blood.”6 In similar terms, Camus declared: “Myths have no life of their own. They wait for us to give them flesh.”
</li><li>“The spirit of revolution lies wholly in man’s protest against the human condition. Under the different forms that it assumes, it is … the only eternal theme of art and religion. A revolution is always carried out against the Gods—from that of Prometheus onwards.”
</li><li>“Force is as pitiless to the man who possesses it, or thinks he does, as it is to its victims; the second it crushes, the first it intoxicates. The truth is, nobody really possesses it.”
</li><li>“All can be justified, no one is just.”
</li><li>Herein laid the difference between Camus and his German friend: “Simply that you readily accepted despair and I never yielded to it. Simply that you saw the injustice of our condition to the point of being willing to add to it, whereas it seemed to me that man must exalt justice in order to fight against injustice, create happiness in order to protest against the universe of unhappiness.”
</li><li>To save the life of an individual “in a world where the humanity of so many others is lost to absurdity and misery … amounts to saving oneself.”
</li><li>“I am an average man [and] the values that I must defend and illustrate today are average values,”
</li><li>I think that by retaining one’s childhood love of such things as trees, fishes, butterflies and—to return to my first instance—toads, one makes a peaceful and decent future a little more probable, and that by preaching the doctrine that nothing is to be admired except steel and concrete, one merely makes it a little surer that human beings will have no outlet for their surplus energy except in hatred and leader worship.
</li><li>Moreover, beauty defeats, if only for short moments, the selfish concerns and preoccupations that mostly govern our lives. Filled with wonder, or filled with love, we forget ourselves—a precondition for making room for others. For Simone Weil, this was the work of attention: in order to truly see, to open ourselves to beauty and justice, we must suspend our thought, “leaving it detached, empty and ready to be penetrated by the object.”14 The moments among the ruins at Tipasa, stretched on the sand of an Algiers beach, climbing the mountains of Kabylia, moments when he was alone and silence reigned, were moments for Camus when his dedication to the cause of justice was again justified.

</h4><ul><li>But you are wrong if you think Fortune has changed towards you. Change is her normal behaviour, her true nature. In the very act of changing she has preserved her own particular kind of constancy towards you. She was exactly the same when she was flattering you and luring you on with enticements of a false kind of happiness.
</li><li>On the other hand, if you do not consider that you have been lucky because your onetime reasons for rejoicing have passed away, you cannot now think of yourself as in misery, because the very things that seem miserable are also passing away.
</li><li>How many men do you think would believe themselves almost in heaven if they possessed even the smallest part of the luck you still enjoy?
</li><li>When you think of your future fame you think you are creating for yourself a kind of immortality. But if you think of the infinite recesses of eternity you have little cause to take pleasure in any continuation of your name. The span of a single second can be compared with ten thousand years, but minute though it may be, it still has a value in proportion because each is a finite measure of time. But ten thousand years, or any multiple of it however great, cannot be compared with unending eternity. For while finite things can be compared with one another, the finite and the infinite can never be compared. So however protracted the life of your fame, when compared with unending eternity it is shown to be not just little, but nothing at all.
</li><li>For bad fortune, I think, is more use to a man than good fortune. Good fortune always seems to bring happiness, but deceives you with her smiles, whereas bad fortune is always truthful because by change she shows her true fickleness. Good fortune deceives, but bad fortune enlightens. With her display of specious riches good fortune enslaves the minds of those who enjoy her, while bad fortune gives men release through the recognition of how fragile a thing happiness is.
</li><li>Your own nature doesn’t make you look beautiful. It is due to the weak eyesight of the people who see you. Think how excessive this desire for the good of the body is, when, as you know, all that you admire can be reduced to nothing by three days of burning fever.
</li><li>Since it is through the possession of happiness that people become happy, and since happiness is in fact divinity, it is clear that it is through the possession of divinity that they become happy. But by the same logic as men become just through the possession of justice, or wise through the possession of wisdom, so those who possess divinity necessarily become divine. Each happy individual is therefore divine.
</li><li>Providence has given its creatures one great reason to go on living, namely the instinctive desire for the greatest possible self-preservation. There is no reason, therefore, for you to have any doubt that all things have an instinctive desire to preserve their life and avoid destruction.’
</li><li>‘This is why among wise men there is no place at all left for hatred. For no one except the greatest of fools would hate good men. And there is no reason at all for hating the bad. For just as weakness is a disease of the body, so wickedness is a disease of the mind. And if this is so, since we think of people who are sick in body as deserving sympathy rather than hatred, much more so do they deserve pity rather than blame who suffer an evil more severe than any physical illness.
</li><li>‘If chance is defined as an event produced by random motion without any causal nexus, I would say that there is no such thing as chance, and that apart from signifying the subject matter of our discussion it is a completely meaningless word. If God imposes order upon all things, there is no opportunity for random events.
</li><li>Human souls are of necessity more free when they continue in the contemplation of the mind of God and less free when they descend to bodies, and less still when they are imprisoned in earthly flesh and blood. They reach an extremity of enslavement when they give themselves up to wickedness and lose possession of their proper reason.

</h4><ul><li>Let us therefore agree that the idea of eternal return implies a perspective from which things appear other than as we know them: they appear without the mitigating circumstance of their transitory nature. This mitigating circumstance prevents us from coming to a verdict. For how can we condemn something that is ephemeral, in transit?
</li><li>We can never know what to want, because, living only one life, we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come.
</li><li>"The important thing is to abide by the rule of threes. Either you see a woman three times in quick succession and then never again, or you maintain relations over the years but make sure that the rendezvous are at least three weeks apart."
</li><li>Love does not make itself felt in the desire for copulation (a desire that extends to an infinite number of women) but in the desire for shared sleep (a desire limited to one woman).
</li><li>During those two beautiful days of melancholy, his compassion (that curse of emotional telepathy) had taken a holiday. It had slept the sound Sunday sleep of a miner who, after a hard week's work, needs to gather strength for his Monday shift.
</li><li>Chance and chance alone has a message for us. Everything that occurs out of necessity, everything expected, repeated day in and day out, is mute. Only chance can speak to us.
</li><li>She had never been ambitious out of vanity. All she had ever wanted was to escape from her mother's world.
</li><li>We might also call vertigo the intoxication of the weak. Aware of his weakness, a man decides to give in rather than stand up to it. He is drunk with weakness, wishes to grow even weaker, wishes to fall down in the middle of the main square in front of everybody, wishes to be down, lower than down.
</li><li>While people are fairly young and the musical composition of their lives is still in its opening bars, they can go about 89 writing it together and exchange motifs (the way Tomas and Sabina exchanged the motif of the bowler hat), but if they meet when they are older, like Franz and Sabina, their musical compositions are more or less complete, and every motif, every object, every word means something different to each of them.
</li><li>Having a public, keeping a public in mind, means living in lies.
</li><li>The goals we pursue are always veiled. A girl who longs for marriage longs for something she knows nothing about. The boy who hankers after fame has no idea what fame is. The thing that gives our every move its meaning is always totally unknown to us.
</li><li>Indeed, the only truly serious questions are ones that even a child can formulate. Only the most naive of questions are truly serious. They are the questions with no answers.
</li><li>Anyone who thinks that the Communist regimes of Central Europe are exclusively the work of criminals is overlooking a basic truth: the criminal regimes were made not by criminals but by enthusiasts convinced they had discovered the only road to paradise. They defended that road so valiantly that they were forced to execute many people. Later it became clear that there was no paradise, that the enthusiasts were therefore murderers.
</li><li>How could someone who had so little respect for people be so dependent on what they thought of him?
</li><li>The novel is not the author's confession; it is an investigation of human life in the trap the world has become.
</li><li>If it were possible to raise the penis by means of a simple command, then sexual excitement would have no place in the world. The penis would rise not because we are excited but because we order it to do so.
</li><li>Yes, a husband's funeral is a wife's true wedding! The climax of her life's work! The reward for her sufferings!
</li><li>The very beginning of Genesis tells us that God created man in order to give him dominion over fish and fowl and all creatures. Of course, Genesis was written by a man, not a horse. There is no certainty that God actually did grant man dominion over other creatures. What seems more likely, in fact, is that man invented God to sanctify the dominion that he had usurped for himself over the cow and the horse. Yes, the right to kill a deer or a cow is the only thing all of mankind can agree upon, even during the bloodiest of wars.
</li><li>True human goodness, in all its purity and freedom, can come to the fore only when its recipient has no power.
</li><li>It is a completely selfless love: Tereza did not want anything of Karenin; she did not ever ask him to love her back. Nor had she ever asked herself the questions that plague human couples: Does he love me? Does he love anyone more than me? Does he love me more than I love him? Perhaps all the questions we ask of love, to measure, test, probe, and save it, have the additional effect of cutting it short. Perhaps the reason we are unable to love is that we yearn to be loved, that is, we demand something (love) from our partner instead of delivering ourselves up to him demand-free and asking for nothing but his company.

Every friend whom not thy fantastic will but the great and tender heart in thee craveth, shall lock thee in his embrace. And this because the heart in thee is the heart of all; not a valve, not a wall, not an intersection is there anywhere in nature, but one blood rolls uninterruptedly an endless circulation through all men, as the water of the globe is all one sea, and, truly seen, its tide is one.

</li><li>He who knows the most; he who knows what sweets and virtues are in the ground, the waters, the plants, the heavens, and how to come at these enchantments, is the rich and royal man.
</li><li>Conversation, character, were the avowed ends; wealth was good as it appeased the animal cravings, cured the smoky chimney, silenced the creaking door, brought friends together in a warm and quiet room, and kept the children and the dinner-table in a different apartment. Thought, virtue, beauty, were the ends; but it was known that men of thought and virtue sometimes had the headache, or wet feet, or could lose good time whilst the room was getting warm in winter days. Unluckily, in the exertions necessary to remove these inconveniences, the main attention has been diverted to this object; the old aims have been lost sight of, and to remove friction has come to be the end.
</li><li>Every book is a quotation; and every house is a quotation out of all forests and mines and stone quarries; and every man is a quotation from all his ancestors. And this grasping inventor puts all nations under contribution.
</li><li>Great geniuses have the shortest biographies. Their cousins can tell you nothing about them. They lived in their writings, and so their house and street life was trivial and commonplace. If you would know their tastes and complexions, the most admiring of their readers most resembles them.
</li><li>According to the old sentence, “If Jove should descend to the earth, he would speak in the style of Plato.”

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Thursday, March 23, 2023 2:48:48 PM
</h4><ul><li>Narcissus, the experienced reader of souls, had gradually come to recognize that Goldmund was one of those people part of whose lives have been lost; pressure of circumstances or some kind of magic power has obliterated a portion of their past. He realized that nothing would be gained by mere questioning and teaching, that he had overestimated the power of logic and spoken many useless words.
</li><li>New links from soul to soul developed in the warm glow of love; words came later.
</li><li>“I’m serious. We are not meant to come together, not any more than sun and moon were meant to come together, or sea and land. We are sun and moon, dear friend; we are sea and land. It is not our purpose to become each other; it is to recognize each other, to learn to see the other and honor him for what he is: each the other’s opposite and complement.”
</li><li>“Natures of your kind, with strong, delicate senses, the soul-oriented, the dreamers, poets, lovers are almost always superior to us creatures of the mind. You take your being from your mothers. You live fully; you were endowed with the strength of love, the ability to feel. Whereas we creatures of reason, we don’t live fully; we live in an arid land, even though we often seem to guide and rule you. Yours is the plenitude of life, the sap of the fruit, the garden of passion, the beautiful landscape of art. Your home is the earth; ours is the world of ideas. You are in danger of drowning in the world of the senses; ours is the danger of suffocating in an airless void. You are an artist; I am a thinker. You sleep at the mother’s breast; I wake in the desert. For me the sun shines; for you the moon and the stars. Your dreams are of girls; mine of boys…”
</li><li>My goal is this: always to put myself in the place in which I am best able to serve, wherever my gifts and qualities find the best soil, the widest field of action. There is no other goal.”
</li><li>But at the same time he had another feeling: that Narcissus had ceased to be his cautioning, superior guide and awakener. Today he felt he had entered a country in which he must find his own roads, in which no Narcissus could guide him. He was glad that he realized this. As he looked back, the days of his dependence seemed shameful and oppressive to him. Now he had become aware; he was no longer a child, a student.
</li><li>To be a bear and love a she-bear would not be bad, would at least be much better than to keep one’s reason and language and all that, and vegetate alone, sad and unloved.
</li><li>Yes, life itself bore something of guilt within it—why else had a man as pure and aware as Narcissus subjected himself to penance like a condemned felon?
</li><li>No, it was fortunate that love did not need words; or else it would be full of misunderstanding and foolishness.
</li><li>“You are so handsome and you look so happy. But deep inside your eyes there is no gaiety, there is only sorrow, as though your eyes knew that happiness did not exist and that all that is beautiful and lovely does not stay with us long. You have the most beautiful eyes of anyone I know, and the saddest.
</li><li>Since that moment in front of the sweet saintly wooden figure, Goldmund possessed something he had not possessed before, something he had so often mocked or envied in others: a goal!
</li><li>And another thing has struck me: one night, as I had to hold a light for a woman who was giving birth, I saw that the greatest pain and the most intense ecstasy have almost the same expression.”
</li><li>This man, he thought, might also have been a scholar, a quiet earnest searcher, who has dedicated himself to a task that many predecessors have begun before him, that he will one day leave to his successors, a tenacious, long-lived never-ending work, the accumulation of the effort and dedication of many generations.
</li><li>Ah, it was not worth being an artist in order to make little angel figures and similar frivolities, no matter how beautiful. Perhaps the others, the artisans, the burghers, those calm, satisfied souls might find it worthwhile, but not he. To him, art and craftsmanship were worthless unless they burned like the sun and had the power of storms. He had no use for anything that brought only comfort, pleasantness, only small joys. He was searching for other things.
</li><li>Experience taught him that every woman was beautiful and able to bring joy, that a mousy creature whom men ignored was capable of extraordinary fire and devotion, that the wilted had a more maternal, mourningly sweet tenderness, that each woman had her secrets and her charms, and to unlock these made him happy.
</li><li>A man on the day of his wedding or on the day he is knighted, a woman after the birth of her first child might feel such emotions in the heart: a deep reverence, a great earnestness, and at the same time a secret fear of the moment when this high, unique experience would be over, classified, swallowed by the routine of the days.
</li><li>How could those fishermen and fishwives, those haggling shoppers not see these mouths, the deathly frightened eyes and wildly flailing tails, the gruesome, useless, desperate battle, this unbearable transformation from mysterious, miraculously beautiful animals—the quiet last shiver that ran across the dying skin before they lay dead and spent—into flattened, miserable slabs of meat for the tables of those jovial paunches? These people saw nothing, knew nothing, and noticed nothing; nothing touched them.
</li><li>He had only to smell a flower or play with a cat, and his childlike agreement with life came back to him. This time, too, it would come back. Tomorrow or the day after, the world would be good again, it would be wonderful. At least it was so until the sadness returned, the brooding, the remorse for dying fish and wilting flowers, the horror of insensitive, piglike, staring-but-not-seeing human existence.
</li><li>If somebody had told him a few years ago that the day would come when Niklaus would recognize him as an equal and demand his master’s licence from the guild, he would have believed all the happiness in the world was in his hands. And now this achievement was nothing but a faded flower, a dried-up, joyless thing.
</li><li>How lazy, spoiled, and fastidious these fat burghers were, for whom so many sows and calves were killed every day, so many poor, beautiful fish pulled from the river! And he—how spoiled and rotten he had become, how disgustingly like the fat burghers! To a wanderer in a snow-covered field, a dried-up prune or an old crust of bread tasted more delicious than a whole meal here with the prosperous guildsmen. Oh, the roaming life, freedom, the heath in the moonlight, the animal tracks peered at attentively in the gray-dewed morning grass! Here in the city, among the well-established burghers, everything was so easy and cost so little, even love. He had had enough of it. Suddenly he spat on it. Life here had lost its meaning; it was a marrowless bone.
</li><li>A sudden awareness of impermanence washed over him, a feeling that often deeply tortured and intoxicated him. Everything was soon wilted, every desire quickly exhausted; nothing remained but bones and dust. But one thing did remain: the eternal mother, basic, ancient, forever young, with her sad, cruel smile of love. Again he saw her for an instant: a giant figure with stars in her hair. Dreamily she sat on the edge of the world, plucking flower after flower, life after life, with a playful hand, slowly dropping them into the bottomless void.
</li><li>DURING the first days of his new wandering life, in the first greedy whirl of regained freedom, Goldmund had to relearn to live the homeless, timeless life of the traveler. Obedient to no man, dependent only on weather and season, without a goal before them or a roof above them, owning nothing, open to every whim of fate, the homeless wanderers lead their childlike, brave, shabby existence. They are the sons of Adam, who was driven out of Paradise; the brothers of the animals, of innocence. Out of heaven’s hand they accept what is given them from moment to moment: sun, rain, fog, snow, warmth, cold, comfort, and hardship; time does not exist for them and neither does history, or ambition, or that bizarre idol called progress and evolution, in which houseowners believe so desperately. A wayfarer may be delicate or crude, artful or awkward, brave or cowardly—he is always a child at heart, living in the first day of creation, before the beginning of the history of the world, his life always guided by a few simple instincts and needs. He may be intelligent or stupid; he may be deeply aware of the fleeting fragility of all living things, of how pettily and fearfully each living creature carries its bit of warm blood through the glaciers of cosmic space, or he may merely follow the commands of his poor stomach with childlike greed—he is always the opponent, the deadly enemy of the established proprietor, who hates him, despises him, or fears him, because he does not wish to be reminded that all existence is transitory, that life is constantly wilting, that merciless icy death fills the cosmos all around.
</li><li>“You,” he said, “don’t you see that death is everywhere, that people are dying in every house and every town, that everything is full of misery. The fury of those stupid people who burned your father is nothing but misery; it is the result of too much suffering. Look, soon death will get us too, and we’ll rot in the field and the moles will play dice with our bones. Let us live a little before it comes to that and be sweet to each other.
</li><li>He remembered his sadness well, but he could no longer remember what had made him so sad. It was that way with everything: even sadness passed, even pain and despair, as well as the joys. Everything passed, faded, lost its depth, its value, and finally there came a time when one could no longer remember what had pained one so. Pains, too, wilted and faded.
</li><li>Drawing had greatly lessened his feeling of heaviness and lightened the bursting fullness in his soul. As long as he was drawing, he did not know where he was. His world consisted of nothing but a table, white paper, and, at night, a candle.
</li><li>So many widely scattered places, heaths and forests, towns and villages, castles and cloisters, and people alive and dead existed inside him in his memory, his love, his repentance, his longing. And if death caught him too, tomorrow, then all this would fall apart, would vanish, the whole picture book full of women and love, of summer mornings and winter nights. Oh, it was high time that he accomplished something, created something, left something behind that would survive him.
</li><li>Perhaps women had it easier in this respect. Nature had created them in such a way that desire bore its fruit automatically, that the bliss of love became a child. For a man, eternal longing replaced this simple fertility.
</li><li>“Go ahead, say it all, get it all out. But in one thing you are quite wrong: you think that the things you have said are thoughts. But actually they are feelings. They are the feelings of a man preoccupied with the horror of life, and you must not forget that these sad, desperate emotions are balanced by completely different ones! When you feel happy on a horse, riding through a pretty landscape, or when you sneak somewhat recklessly into a castle at night to court a count’s mistress, then the world looks altogether different to you, and no plague-stricken house or burned Jew can prevent you from fulfilling your desire. Is that not so?”
</li><li>“It was the overcoming of the transitory. I saw that something remained of the fools’ play, the death dance of human life, something lasting: works of art. They too will probably perish some day; they’ll burn or crumble or be destroyed. Still, they outlast many human lives; they form a silent empire of images and relics beyond the fleeting moment. To work at that seems good and comforting to me, because it almost succeeds in making the transitory eternal.”
</li><li>“I understand something of what you say, but what does it mean to realize oneself?” “It is a philosophical concept, I can’t express it in any other way. For us disciples of Aristotle and St. Thomas, it is the highest of all concepts: perfect being. God is perfect being. Everything else that exists is only half, only a part, is becoming, is mixed, is made up of potentialities. But God is not mixed. He is one, he has no potentialities but is the total, the complete reality. Whereas we are transitory, we are becoming, we are potentials; there is no perfection for us, no complete being. But wherever we go, from potential to deed, from possibility to realization, we participate in true being, become by a degree more similar to the perfect and divine. That is what it means to realize oneself.
</li><li>While you sing, you don’t wonder whether or not singing is useful; you sing. That’s how you are to pray.”
</li><li>“I’m learning a great deal from you, Goldmund. I’m beginning to understand what art is. Formerly it seemed to me that, compared to thinking and science, it could not be taken altogether seriously. I thought something like this: since man is a dubious mixture of mind and matter, since the mind unlocks recognition of the eternal to him, while matter pulls him down and binds him to the transitory, he should strive away from the senses and toward the mind if he wishes to elevate his life and give it meaning. I did pretend, out of habit, to hold art in high esteem, but actually I was arrogant and looked down upon it. Only now do I realize how many paths there are to knowledge and that the path of the mind is not the only one and perhaps not even the best one. It is my way, of course; and I’ll stay on it. But I see that you, on the opposite road, on the road of the senses, have seized the secret of being just as deeply and can express it in a much more lively fashion than most thinkers are able to do.”
</li><li>One could speak intelligently with men, and they understood an artist’s work, but all the rest—chatting, tenderness, games, love, pleasure without thought—did not flourish among men, for that one needed women, wandering, freedom, and ever new impressions. Everything around him was a little gray and serious here, a little heavy and manly, and he had become contaminated; it had crept into his blood.
</li><li>But seen from above, with God’s eyes—was this exemplary life of order and discipline, of renunciation of the world and of the joys of the senses, of remoteness from dirt and blood, of withdrawal into philosophy and meditation any better than Goldmund’s life? Had man really been created to live a regulated life, with hours and duties indicated by prayer bells? Had man really been created to study Aristotle and Saint Thomas, to know Greek, to extinguish his senses, to flee the world? Had God not created him with senses and instincts, with blood-colored darknesses, with the capacity for sin, lust, and despair?
</li><li>Yes, and was it not perhaps more childlike and human to lead a Goldmund-life, more courageous, more noble perhaps in the end to abandon oneself to the cruel stream of reality, to chaos, to commit sins and accept their bitter consequences rather than live a clean life with washed hands outside the world, laying out a lonely harmonious thought-garden, strolling sinlessly among one’s sheltered flower beds. Perhaps it was harder, braver and nobler to wander through forests and along the highways with torn shoes, to suffer sun and rain, hunger and need, to play with the joys of the senses and pay for them with suffering.

</h4><ul><li>his poems send a refreshingly powerful message: To live is to live in an eternal presence.
</li><li>A. E. Christensen, the eminent Danish scholar of Khayyam in a treatise he gave to V. Rozen, another Khayyam Scholar mentions that within 350 years after Khayyam’s death, the authentic and inauthentic Ruba‘iyyat were inseparable. so intertwined that distinguishing them remains impossible.
</li><li>Despite taking such care in using the Ruba‘iyyat, the reader is encouraged to focus on Khayyamian school of thought as the representative of a worldview rather than an individual.
</li><li>Our Khayyam therefore, should not be viewed only as a historical figure but a school of thought which, as it will be demonstrated, proclaims the irreconcilability of faith and reason, respecting and questioning both simultaneously. This unique figure makes a sincere attempt not to reconcile faith and reason but to acknowledge these two irreconcilable poles of human existence, the eternal struggle between the heart and the mind. The question for him was not how these two discourses can be reconciled but how one can live amidst such a tension, not to give in to easy pre-fabricated answers and not to fall into nihilism and heresy.
</li><li>Khayyam’s respect and reverence for Avicenna remained categorical until the last day of his life when he was allegedly reading the Ishārāt just hours before he died.
</li><li>If God is all-good but from Him come all things, then evil must have come from Him. Since in the beginning there was only one God and nothing else, it then follows that evil must have been part of God.
</li><li>Thus, in Divine and prophetic command and prohibition, there are three benefits: First, through obedience, the soul is so cleansed through asceticism; bodily desires are reduced and the power that causes intellectual powers from darkening is prevented. Second, to make reflection upon Divine and eschatological matters habitual so through it, one may observe prayers, prevent vanity so he may contemplate upon the incorporeal domain. This is so Divine names are glorified within him, meaning, He who has brought all the existents into existence, glory be upon Him, and sacred are His names, and to know that there is no deity except God. Existents through an orderly succession have emanated from Him and His wisdom has been verified through analogies that are not illusory and sophistry. Thirdly, through verses, He reprimands and promises what is necessary for the implementation of religious laws. He who is to implement the Shari‘ah should inform the people so the principle of justice and coexistence may well be put in place. This is so the order of the universe as the wisdom of God, most high has deemed necessary may remain so.58

</h4><ul><li>Socialism and communism quickly changed from a movement whose aim was a new society and a new man into one whose ideal was a bourgeois life for all, the universalized bourgeois as the men and women of the future.
</li><li>When he came to Oslo to accept the Nobel Prize for Peace (1952), Albert Schweitzer challenged the world “to dare to face the situation. . . . Man has become a superman. . . . But the superman with the superhuman power has not risen to the level of superhuman reason. To the degree to which his power grows he becomes more and more a poor man. . . . It must shake up our conscience that we become all the more inhuman the more we grow into supermen.”
</li><li>Ours is the greatest social experiment ever made to solve the question whether pleasure (as a passive affect in contrast to the active affect, well-being and joy) can be a satisfactory answer to the problem of human existence. For the first time in history the satisfaction of the pleasure drive is not only the privilege of a minority but is possible for more than half the population. The experiment has already answered the question in the negative.
</li><li>The pretense of the communists that their system will end class struggle by abolishing classes is fiction, for their system is based on the principle of unlimited consumption as the goal of living. As long as everybody wants to have more, there must be formations of classes, there must be class war, and in global terms, there must be international war.
</li><li>Jesus teaches: “For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it. For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?”
</li><li>Marx taught that luxury is as much a vice as poverty and that our goal should be to be much, not to have much.
</li><li>By saying “I have a problem” instead of “I am troubled,” subjective experience is eliminated: the I of experience is replaced by the it of possession. I have transformed my feeling into something I possess: the problem. But “problem” is an abstract expression for all kinds of difficulties. I cannot have a problem, because it is not a thing that can be owned; it, however, can have me. That is to say, I have transformed myself into “a problem” and am now owned by my creation. This way of speaking betrays a hidden, unconscious alienation.
</li><li>For another example: To say, “I have great love for you,” is meaningless. Love is not a thing that one can have, but a process, an inner activity that one is the subject of. I can love, I can be in love, but in loving, I have . . . nothing. In fact, the less I have, the more I can love.
</li><li>To those who believe that to have is a most natural category of human existence it may come as a surprise to learn that many languages have no word for “to have.” In Hebrew, for instance, “I have” must be expressed by the indirect form jesh li (“it is to me”).
</li><li>Among other facts, this suggests that literacy is by no means the blessing it is advertised to be, especially when people use it merely to read material that impoverishes their capacity to experience and to imagine.
</li><li>In a very ingenious experiment with monkeys, J. M. R. Delgado (1967) has shown that if the dominant animal even momentarily loses the qualities that constitute its competence, its authority ends.
</li><li>According to Marx, one needs to destroy illusions in order to create the conditions that make illusions unnecessary.
</li><li>Faith, in the having mode, is a crutch for those who want to be certain, those who want an answer to life without daring to search for it themselves.
</li><li>The marriage contract gives each partner the exclusive possession of the other’s body, feelings, and care. Nobody has to be won over any more, because love has become something one has, a property. The two cease to make the effort to be lovable and to produce love, hence they become boring, and hence their beauty disappears. They are disappointed and puzzled. Are they not the same persons any more? Did they make a mistake in the first place? Each usually seeks the cause of the change in the other and feels defrauded. What they do not see is that they no longer are the same people they were when they were in love with each other; that the error that one can have love has led them to cease loving. Now, instead of loving each other, they settle for owning together what they have: money, social standing, a home, children. Thus, in some cases, the marriage initiated on the basis of love becomes transformed into a friendly ownership, a corporation in which the two egotisms are pooled into one: that of the “family.”
</li><li>The real successors to the Hebrew prophets were the great scholars, the rabbis, and none more clearly so than the founder of the Diaspora: Rabbi Jochanan ben Sakai.
</li><li>The person who wants nothing is the person who is not greedy for anything: this is the essence of Eckhart’s concept of nonattachment.
</li><li>Again, he is poor who knows nothing. We have sometimes said that man ought to live as if he did not live, neither for self, nor for the truth, nor for God. But to that point, we shall say something else and go further. The man who is to achieve this poverty shall live as a man who does not even know that he lives, neither for himself, nor for the truth, nor for god. More; he shall be quit and empty of all knowledge, so that no knowledge of god exists in him; for when a man’s existence is of God’s external species, there is no other life in him: his life is himself. Therefore we say that a man ought to be empty of his own knowledge, as he was when he did not exist, and let God achieve what he will and man be unfettered
</li><li>private property (from Latin privare, “to deprive of”),
</li><li>Perhaps the greatest enjoyment is not so much in owning material things but in owning living beings. In a patriarchal society even the most miserable of men in the poorest of classes can be an owner of property—in his relationship to his wife, his children, his animals, over whom he can feel he is absolute master. At least for the man in a patriarchal society, having many children is the only way to own persons without needing to work to attain ownership, and without capital investment.
</li><li>Speaking of having something permanently rests upon the illusion of a permanent and indestructible substance. If I seem to have everything, I have—in reality—nothing, since my having, possessing, controlling an object is only a transitory moment in the process of living.
</li><li>But there is also a reverse relationship: it has me, because my sense of identity, i.e., of sanity, rests upon my having it (and as many things as possible).
</li><li>Not sex, however, but the breaking of human will is the reason for vilifying sex.
</li><li>All data indicate that heteronomous interference with the child’s and the later person’s growth process is the deepest root of mental pathology, especially of destructiveness.
</li><li>Yet none of these experiences can be fully expressed in words. The words are vessels that are filled with experience that overflows the vessels. The words point to an experience; they are not the experience. The moment that I express what I experience exclusively in thought and words, the experience has gone: it has dried up, is dead, a mere thought.
</li><li>Perhaps the being mode may best be described in a symbol suggested to me by Max Hunziger: A blue glass appears to be blue when light shines through it because it absorbs all other colors and thus does not let them pass. This is to say, we call a glass “blue” precisely because it does not retain the blue waves. It is named not for what it possesses but for what it gives out.
</li><li>That Aristotle did not share our present concepts of activity and passivity becomes unmistakably clear if we will consider that for him the highest form of praxis, i.e., of activity—even above political activity—is the contemplative life, devoted to the search for truth.
</li><li>For Spinoza mental health is, in the last analysis, a manifestation of right living; mental illness, a symptom of the failure to live according to the requirements of human nature. “But if the greedy person thinks only of money and possessions, the ambitious one only of fame, one does not think of them as being insane, but only as annoying; generally one has contempt for them. But factually, greediness, ambition, and so forth are forms of insanity, although usually one does not think of them as ‘illness’” (Ethics, 4, prop. 44).
</li><li>For Marx the question was: Who should rule whom—should life rule the dead, or the dead rule life? Socialism, for him, represented a society in which life had won over the dead.
</li><li>A Talmudic legend has expressed this concept of the repression of the truth, in a poetic form: when a child is born, an angel touches its head, so that it forgets the knowledge of the truth that it has at the moment of birth. If the child did not forget, its life would become unbearable.
</li><li>Nothing unites people more (without restricting their individuality) than sharing their admiration and love for a person; sharing an idea, a piece of music, a painting, a symbol; sharing in a ritual—and sharing sorrow. The experience of sharing makes and keeps the relation between two individuals alive; it is the basis of all great religious, political, and philosophical movements.
</li><li>There is only one way—taught by the Buddha, by Jesus, by the Stoics, by Master Eckhart—to truly overcome the fear of dying, and that way is by not hanging onto life, not experiencing life as a possession.
</li><li>The socioeconomic structure of a society molds the social character of its members so that they wish to do what they have to do.
</li><li>The “identity crisis” of modern society is actually the crisis produced by the fact that its members have become selfless instruments, whose identity rests upon their participation in the corporations (or other giant bureaucracies), as a primitive individual’s identity rested upon membership in the clan.
</li><li>“If one takes the world as it is, it is impossible to endow it with meaning in which the aims and goals of Man and of Mankind make sense.”
</li><li>that human beings have an unconditional right to live, regardless of whether they do their “duty to society.” It is a right we guarantee to our pets, but not to our fellow beings.

</h4><ul><li>Montaigne writes, “He who has learned how to die has unlearned how to be a slave.”
</li><li>Now it is time that we were going, I to die and you to live; but which of us has the happier prospect is unknown to anyone but God.
</li><li>Socrates never claimed to know, never promised knowledge to others and, crucially, never accepted a fee.
</li><li>As Marcus Aurelius writes, it is one of “the noblest functions of reason to know whether it is time to walk out of the world or not.”
</li><li>Sadly, it is now almost universally assumed by classical scholars that Pythagoras never existed. It seems that there was a group of people in southern Italy called Pythagoreans who invented a “Founder” for their beliefs who, accordingly, lived and died in a manner consistent with those beliefs.
</li><li>However, Alexander seems to have been more impressed by Diogenes the Cynic and said, with mixed humility, that if he were not himself, the person he would most like to be was Diogenes.
</li><li>The sceptic neither declines nor chooses, but simply suspends judgement and practises silence or aphasia. Thus, the sceptic refuses to either assert or deny that there is life after death, whether the soul is separate from the body or whether there is a heaven or a hell. In neither asserting nor denying anything, one lives in a tranquillity that is open to all forms of inquiry and an utter stranger to any species of dogmatism.
</li><li>In my view, there is no more relevant ancient philosopher for our time than Epicurus, for he combines a thoroughly atomistic, scientific view of nature with an ethical stance that aims at prudence, calm and overcoming the terror of annihilation.
</li><li>The philosopher, for Seneca, enjoys a long life because he does not worry over its shortness. He lives in the present and, in my view, the only immortality that philosophy can promise is to permit us to inhabit the present without concern for the future.
</li><li>There was a monk living in a cave in the desert. His relations according to the flesh let him know, “Your father is very ill, at the point of death: come and receive his inheritance.” He replied to them, “I died to the world before he did and the dead do not inherit from the living.”
</li><li>Although Montaigne was an admirer of Seneca and the Stoics, towards the end of his life he decided that Sceptics like Pyrrho “were the wisest party of philosophy.”
</li><li>Descartes was notoriously itinerant, living at no fewer than thirty-eight addresses during his lifetime.
</li><li>For La Rochefoucauld the philosophers’ contempt for death is but a barely concealed desire for glory and posthumous fame.

</li><li>Malebranche's principal thesis is that we see all things in God. That is, God is the cause of our perception of the world around us.

</li><li>Foucault said, Sexuality is part of our behaviour. It's part of our world freedom. Sexuality is something that we ourselves create. It is our own creation, and much more than the discovery of a secret side of our desire. We have to understand that with our desires go new forms of relationships, new forms of love, new forms of creation. Sex is not a fatality; it's a possibility for creative life. It's not enough to affirm that we are gay but we must also create a gay life.

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Saturday, April 1, 2023 3:09:33 PM
</h4><ul><li>“The first promise of real philosophy is a feeling of fellowship, sympathy, and community with others.”
</li><li>As a senator under Caligula, Seneca began to accumulate vast personal wealth, which he would continue to do throughout his life.
</li><li>How many things we acquire only because others bought them and because they are in a good many homes. Many of our problems are explained by the fact that we copy the example of others: rather than following reason, we are led astray by convention. If only a few people did something, we wouldn’t imitate them. But when the majority starts to act a certain way, we follow along, too, as if something should be more honorable just because it’s more frequent.
</li><li>We admire walls veneered with a thin layer of marble, even though we know what defects the marble is hiding. We deceive our own eyes, and when we have bathed our ceilings with gold, what are we delighting in, except a lie? For we know that beneath this gilding lurks some ugly wood. Nor is such skin-deep decoration spread only over walls and ceilings. All those famous men you see strutting about grandly possess gold-leaf happiness. Look inside, and you’ll see how much corruption lies beneath that flimsy veneer of status.
</li><li>For Seneca and the Stoics, unless you can remove or deconstruct the false beliefs that cause mental suffering, it’s impossible for anyone lead a happier life.
</li><li>Convince yourself of these words: some moments are robbed from us, some are stolen, and some just slip away.
</li><li>“We are mistaken to think that death lies in the future: much of death has already passed us by, unnoticed. Any years behind us are already in the hands of death.”
</li><li>Of all people, only those who find time for philosophy are really at leisure—they alone really live. For not only do they guard over their own lifetimes, they add every age to their own. All the years that passed before them are added to their own.
</li><li>Seneca explains that two major fears everyone needs to work on overcoming are the fear of death and the fear of poverty (or the desire for wealth).
</li><li>Marcus Aurelius also supported this view when he wrote, “Don’t allow the future to trouble you,” because when it does arrive, you’ll face it with the same sense of reason you apply to the present moment.
</li><li>Do you want to know why people are greedy for the future? It’s because no one has yet found himself.
</li><li>The greatest cure for anger is delay. Ask this from anger at the start, not so it will forgive, but so it will evaluate. While its first assaults are heavy, it will retreat if forced to wait. But don’t try to destroy it all at once. If picked away at bit by bit, it will be defeated.
</li><li>“If you want to escape your troubles, you don’t need to be somewhere else: you need to be someone else.”
</li><li>“It’s a mistake,” Seneca wrote, “to believe that anything good or bad is given to us by Fortune.” Rather, Fortune just gives us the raw material for creating good or bad, based on the good or bad qualities within us.
</li><li>According to a study by Marshall Goldsmith, quoted by the Harvard Business Review, most employees spend ten hours or more per month complaining about their bosses or management, or listening to others complain. Even more striking, almost one-third of all employees spend twenty or more hours per month complaining or listening to complaints!
</li><li>one of many possible examples, when he died Michael Jackson was between four hundred and five hundred million dollars in debt.
</li><li>I have never trusted Fortune, even when she seemed to offer peace. All those blessings that she generously bestowed on me—money, position, and influence—I stored in a place from which she could reclaim them without disturbing me. I have maintained a great distance between those things and myself; and so she has taken them away, but not torn them away, from me. No one has been crushed by Fortune unless he was first deceived by her gifts.
</li><li>“If my wealth flows away,” he wrote, “it will only take itself. But if you lose your wealth, you will be in shock, and you’ll feel as though you’ve lost your very self. For me, wealth has a place, but for you, it holds the highest value. In the end, I own my wealth, but your wealth owns you.”
</li><li>Do you ask what you should avoid most of all? A crowd.
</li><li>“A single example of self-indulgence or greed does much harm. A close friend who is overly pampered weakens and softens us. A rich neighbor inflames our greed. A mean-spirited companion rubs off his spite, even on a sincere and spotless fellow.”
</li><li>As if to sum up his belief in social disengagement, Epicurus famously advised, “Live unnoticed.”
</li><li>“A person who just thinks of his contemporaries is born for only a few. Many thousands of years will come, and many thousands of peoples: look toward them too.”35
</li><li>I often felt the urge to end my life, but the old age of my dear father held me back. For while I thought that I could die bravely, I knew he could not bear the loss bravely. And so I commanded myself to live. Sometimes it’s an act of courage just to keep living.
</li><li>As Steve Jobs once said in a speech to college students, When I was seventeen, I read a quote that went something like: “If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.” It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past thirty-three years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today? And whenever the answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.
</li><li>But toward the end of his career, Nietzsche experienced a “perfect day” and a spontaneous feeling of deep gratitude. On that day, not only were the grapes ripening under the autumn sun, but, as he described it, “a ray of sunshine had fallen on my life.” As he wrote, “I looked behind me, I looked before me, and never have I seen so many good things at once.” Then Nietzsche asked, “How could I fail to be grateful to my entire life?”
</li><li>“Our mind is never greater than when it sets aside those things that are not its own: It makes peace for itself by fearing nothing; it creates wealth for itself by desiring nothing.”
</li><li>Therefore, if you decide that you are serious about reading Seneca and want the entire collection of his letters, your choice is simple. Get the wonderful Letters on Ethics to Lucilius, translated by Margaret Graver and A. A. Long (University of Chicago Press).

</h2><h4>First Highlight:   Sunday, April 2, 2023 3:58:03 PM
</h4><ul><li>Yet each person can quickly test himself or herself by asking what he or she finds particularly valuable, thereby getting an idea of what would happen if he or she were to lose what was important and valuable: whether he or she would lose the ground from under his or her feet and whether life would then become meaningless. If one can then no longer feel any self-reliance or self-value (intrinsic to oneself), if life and work are no longer worth anything, then one is determining life according to an orientation toward having: having a fine vocation, obedient children, a good rapport, profound insights, better arguments, and so forth.
</li><li>It seems that nature—or if you will, the process of evolution—has endowed every living being with the wish to live, and whatever he believes to be his reasons are only secondary thoughts by which he rationalizes this biologically given impulse.
</li><li>Our reason functions only to the degree to which it is not flooded by greed.
</li><li>Indeed, this chapter could be ended right here by saying: Read the writings of Masters of Living, learn to understand the true meaning of their words, form your own conviction of what you want to do with your life; and get over the naïve idea that you need no master, no guide, no model, that you can find out in a lifetime what the greatest minds of the human species have discovered in many thousands of years—and each one of them building with the stones and sketches their predecessors left them.
</li><li>I beg the reader to be aware of the fact that words, in and by themselves, have no reality, except in terms of the context in which they are used, in terms of the intentions and the character of the one who uses them. If they are read in a one-dimensional way, without a depth perspective, they hide ideas rather than communicate them.
</li><li>In this latter sense the Buddha has defined trivial talk. He said: If the mind of a monk inclines to talking, he should think thus: “I shall not engage in the low kind of talk that is vulgar, worldly and unprofitable; that does not lead to detachment, dispassionateness, cessation, tranquility, direct knowledge, enlightenment, Nirvana; namely talk about kings, thieves, ministers, armies, famine and war; about eating, drinking, clothing and lodgings; about garlands, perfumes, relatives, vehicles, villages, towns, cities and countries; about women and wine, the gossip of the street and the well, talk about ancestors, about various trifles, tales about the origins of the world and the sea, talk about things being so or otherwise, and similar matters.” Thus he has clear comprehension. “But talk that is helpful for leading the austere life, useful for mental clarity, that leads to complete detachment, dispassionateness, cessation, tranquility, direct knowledge, enlightenment and Nibbana; that is talk on frugality, contentedness, solitude, seclusion, application of energy, virtue, concentration, wisdom, deliverance and on the knowledge and vision bestowed by deliverance—in such talk shall I engage.” Thus he has clear comprehension.
</li><li>Perhaps most trivial talk is a need to talk about oneself; hence, the never-ending subject of health and sickness, children, travel, successes, what one did, and the innumerable daily things that seem to be important. Since one cannot talk about oneself all the time without being thought a bore, one must exchange the privilege by a readiness to listen to others talking about themselves.
</li><li>Modern man is alienated from others and confronted with a dilemma: He is afraid of close contact with another and equally afraid to be alone and have no contact. It is the function of trivial conversation to answer the question “How do I remain alone without being lonely?”
</li><li>There is no contact between human beings that does not affect both of them. No meeting between two people, no conversation between them, except perhaps the most casual one, leaves either one of them unchanged—even though the change may be so minimal as to be unrecognizable except by its cumulative effect when such meetings are frequent.
</li><li>If other people do not understand our behavior—so what? Their request that we must only do what they understand is an attempt to dictate to us. If this is being “asocial” or “irrational” in their eyes, so be it. Mostly they resent our freedom and our courage to be ourselves. We owe nobody an explanation or an accounting, as long as our acts do not hurt or infringe on them. How many lives have been ruined by this need to “explain,” which usually implies that the explanation be “understood,” i.e., approved. Let your deeds be judged, and from your deeds your real intentions, but know that a free person owes an explanation only to himself—to his reason and his conscience—and to the few who may have a justified claim for explanation.
</li><li>Force is camouflaged by consent; the consent is brought about by methods of mass suggestion.
</li><li>The general criterion of a whim is that it responds to the question “Why not?” and not to the question “Why?”
</li><li>It is possible to formulate a general psychological law: The greater the sense of powerlessness and the greater the lack of authentic will, the more grows either submission or an obsessional desire for satisfaction of one’s whims and the insistence on arbitrariness.
</li><li>The first condition for more than mediocre achievement in any field, including that of the art of living, is to will one thing.[x] To will one thing presupposes having made a decision, having committed oneself to one goal. It means that the whole person is geared and devoted to the one thing he has decided on, that all his energies flow in the direction of this chosen goal.
</li><li>In the first place, the question is in part purely abstract, and hence a wrong question; most individuals as well as social classes who cannot bear disillusionment without positive solutions will simply not listen to, understand, and certainly not agree with the disillusioning analysis, even if the critical thinker speaks with the voice of an angel.
</li><li>There is still another reason why people are afraid of concentrating: They think that concentrating is too strenuous an activity and that they would get tired quickly. In fact the opposite is true, as anyone can observe in oneself. Lack of concentration makes one tired, while concentration wakes one up. There is no mystery in this. In unconcentrated activity no energy is mobilized, since a low level of energy is sufficient to do the task. Mobilization of energy, which has a psychic as well as a physiological aspect, has the effect of making one feel alive.
</li><li>Buddhist meditation by Nyanaponika Mahathera,
</li><li>Every creative thinker can only think in terms of the thought patterns and categories of his culture. Often his most original thought is not “thinkable” and hence he has to formulate his thought by distorting (or narrowing down) his discoveries in order that they be thinkable. The original idea must be expressed at first in erroneous forms, until the development of thought, based on the development of society, permits that the older formulations can be liberated from their time-bound errors and assume a significance that is even greater than the author himself may have believed.
</li><li>Another reason for not trying psychoanalysis lies in the danger that one is seeking—and finds—in the psychoanalyst a new father figure on whom one becomes dependent, thus blocking one’s own further development.
</li><li>In discovering transference he discovered a special case of one of the most powerful strivings in man, that of idolatry (alienation). It is striving that is rooted in the ambiguity of man’s existence and that has the aim of finding an answer to the uncertainty of life by transforming a person, an institution, an idea into an absolute, i.e., into an idol by the submission to which the illusion of certainty is created.
</li><li>To work for years with a “wrong” analyst can be as harmful as being married for years to the wrong person.
</li><li>In short, as Goethe put it, only if we can “imagine ourselves as the author of any conceivable crime,” and mean it, can we be reasonably sure of having dropped the mask and of being on the way to becoming aware of who we are.
</li><li>in fact the best proof that one acts rightly is that it is unpleasant, the proof of the opposite that one likes to do it.
</li><li>In addition, the individuality of commodities is stressed: The alleged differences between cars, cigarettes, toothpaste, which are essentially the same (in the same price class), serve the purpose of creating the illusion of the individual man or woman freely choosing individual things.
</li><li>Physical effects (results) are no longer proportionate to human effort, and this separation between effort (and skill) and result is one of the most significant and pathogenic features of modern society, because it tends to degrade effort and to minimize its significance.
</li><li>The miser as well as the waster is inwardly passive and unproductive. Neither is actively related to anything or anybody, neither changes and grows in the process of living; each only represents one of two different forms of non-aliveness.
</li><li>The more a person has, the less is he attracted to making active efforts.[xlvii] Having and inner laziness ultimately form a vicious circle, reinforcing each other.
</li><li>The best example is the private automobile. It can be argued that such is functional property and for this reason not equivalent to dead possession. This would be true if the private car were really functional—but it is not. It does not stimulate or activate any of man’s powers. It is a distraction, enables a person to run away from himself, produces a false sense of strength, helps to form a sense of identity based on the brand of car the man drives; it prevents him from walking and thinking, is sufficiently exacting to make a concentrated conversation impossible, and stimulates competition. One would need to write a book in order to give a fill description of the irrational and pathogenic function of the type of consumption that the private automobile represents.
</li><li>If “well-being” (in the sense defined in the beginning of this book)—functioning well as a person, not as an instrument—is the supreme goal of one’s efforts, two specific ways stand out that lead to the attainment of this goal: Breaking through one’s narcissism and breaking through the property structure of one’s existence.

</li><li>The death of a parent, he wrote, “despite our preparation, indeed, despite our age, dislodges things deep in us, sets off reactions that surprise us and that may cut free memories and feelings that we had thought gone to ground long ago. We might, in that indeterminate period they call mourning, be in a submarine, silent on the ocean’s bed, aware of the depth charges, now near and now far, buffeting us with recollections.”

</li><li>“The mourner is in fact ill, but because this state of mind is common and seems so natural to us, we do not call mourning an illness…. To put my conclusion more precisely: I should say that in mourning the subject goes through a modified and transitory manic-depressive state and overcomes it.”

But in our human foolishness and short-sightedness we imagine divine grace to be finite. For this reason we tremble…’ Never till now had the General stated that he trembled; he was genuinely surprised and even shocked at hearing his own voice proclaim the fact. ‘We tremble before making our choice in life, and after having made it again tremble in fear of having chosen wrong. But the moment comes when our eyes are opened, and we see and realize that grace is infinite. Grace, my friends, demands nothing from us but that we shall await it with confidence and acknowledge it in gratitude. Grace, brothers, makes no conditions and singles out none of us in particular; grace takes us all to its bosom and proclaims general amnesty. See! that which we have chosen is given us, and that which we have refused is, also and at the same time, granted us. Ay, that which we have rejected is poured upon us abundantly.

</li><li>Around town, parents were using strips of tires to extend the life of worn-out shoes,
</li><li>By Christmas 1933, two million Americans were homeless. Tens of thousands rode the rails in search of a job. One in four Americans was out of work. In Ohio, it was worse. There the jobless numbered more than one in three. And in industrial centers like Canton some put the number at 50 percent. There was no purpose in counting. No relief was to be had.
